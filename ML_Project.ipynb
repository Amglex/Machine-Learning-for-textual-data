And we had to give him answers; how were we to have any idea that he would say, Come back with your brother?\\n8 Then Judah said to Israel, his father, Send the boy with me, and let us be up and going, so that we and you and our little ones may not come to destruction.\\n9 Put him into my care and make me responsible for him: if I do not give him safely back to you, let mine be the sin for ever.\\n10 Truly, if we had not let the time go by, we might have come back again by now.\\n11 Then their father Israel said to them, If it has to be so, then do this: take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels to give the man, perfumes and honey and spices and nuts:\\n12 And take twice as much money with you; that is to say, take back the money which was put in your bags, for it may have been an error;\\n13 And take your brother and go back to the man:\\n14 And may God, the Ruler of all, give you mercy before the man, so that he may give you back your other brother and Benjamin. If my children are to be taken from me; there is no help for it.\\n15 So they took what their father said for the man, and twice as much money in their hands, and Benjamin, and went on their journey to Egypt, and came before Joseph.\\n16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin, he said to his chief servant, Take these men into my house, and make ready a meal, for they will take food with me in the middle of the day.\\n17 And the servant did as Joseph said, and took the men into Joseph's house.\\n18 Now the men were full of fear because they had been taken into Joseph's house and they said, It is because of the money which was put back in our bags the first time; he is looking for something against us, so that he may come down on us and take us and our asses for his use.\\n19 So they went up to Joseph's chief servant at the door of the house,\\n20 And said, O my lord, we only came down the first time to get food;\\n21 And when we came to our night's resting-place, on opening our bags we saw that every man's money was in the mouth of his bag, all our money in full weight: and we have it with us to give it back;\\n22 As well as more money, with which to get food: we have no idea who put our money in our bags.\\n23 Then the servant said, Peace be with you: have no fear: your God, even the God of your father, has put wealth in your bags for you: I had your money. Then he let Simeon come out to them.\\n24 And the servant took them into Joseph's house, and gave them water for washing their feet; and he gave their asses food.\\n25 And they got ready the things for Joseph before he came in the middle of the day: for word was given to them that they were to have a meal there.\\n26 And when Joseph came in, they gave him the things which they had for him, and went down to the earth before him.\\n27 And he said, How are you? is your father well, the old man of whom you were talking to me? is he still living?\\n28 And they said, Your servant, our father, is well, he is still living. And they went down on their faces before him.\\n29 Then, lifting up his eyes, he saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother's son, and he said, Is this your youngest brother of whom you gave me word? And he said, God be good to you, my son.\\n30 Then Joseph's heart went out to his brother, and he went quickly into his room, for he was overcome with weeping.\\n31 Then, after washing his face, he came out, and controlling his feelings said, Put food before us.\\n32 And they put a meal ready for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who were with him by themselves; because the Egyptians may not take food with the Hebrews, for that would make them unclean.\\n33 And they were all given their seats before him in order of birth, from the oldest to the youngest: so that they were looking at one another in wonder.\\n34 And Joseph sent food to them from his table, but he sent five times as much to Benjamin as to any of the others.

So he did as Joseph said.\\n3 And at dawn the men, with their asses, were sent away.\\n4 And when they had gone only a little way out of the town, Joseph said to the servant who was over his house, Go after them; and when you overtake them, say to them, Why have you done evil in reward for good?\\n5 Is not this the cup from which my lord takes wine and by which he gets knowledge of the future? Truly, you have done evil.\\n6 So he overtook them and said these words to them.\\n7 And they said to him, Why does my lord say such words as these? far be it from your servants to do such a thing:\\n8 See, the money which was in the mouth of our bags we gave back to you when we came again from Canaan: how then might we take silver or gold from your lord's house?\\n9 If it comes to light that any of your servants has done this, let him be put to death, and we will be your lord's servants.\\n10 And he said, Let it be as you say: he in whose bag it is seen will become my servant; and you will not be responsible.\\n11 Then every man quickly got his bag down and undid it.\\n12 And he made a search, starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was in Benjamin's bag.\\n13 Then in bitter grief they put the bags on the asses again and went back to the town.\\n14 So Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house; and he was still there: and they went down on their faces before him.\\n15 And Joseph said, What is this thing which you have done? had you no thought that such a man as I would have power to see what is secret?\\n16 And Judah said, What are we to say to my lord? how may we put ourselves right in his eyes? God has made clear the sin of your servants: now we are in your hands, we and the man in whose bag your cup was seen.\\n17 Then he said, Far be it from me to do so: but the man who had my cup will be my servant; and you may go back to your father in peace.\\n18 Then Judah came near him, and said, Let your servant say a word in my lord's ears, and let not your wrath be burning against your servant: for you are in the place of Pharaoh to us.\\n19 My lord said to his servants, Have you a father or a brother?\\n20 And we said to my lord, We have an old father and a young child, whom he had when he was old; his brother is dead and he is the only son of his mother, and is very dear to his father.\\n21 And you said to your servants, Let him come down to me with you, so that I may see him.\\n22 And we said to my lord, His father will not let him go; for if he went away his father would come to his death.\\n23 But you said to your servants, If your youngest brother does not come with you, you will not see my face again.\\n24 And when we went back to your servant, our father, we gave him an account of my lord's words.\\n25 And our father said, Go again and get us a little food.\\n26 And we said, Only if our youngest brother goes with us will we go down; for we may not see the man's face again if our youngest brother is not with us.\\n27 And our father said to us, You have knowledge that my wife gave me two sons;\\n28 The one went away from me, and I said, Truly he has come to a violent death; and from that time I have not seen him,\\n29 If now you take this one from me, and some evil comes to him, you will make my grey head go down in sorrow to the underworld.\\n30 If then I go back to your servant, my father, without the boy, because his life and the boy's life are one,\\n31 When he sees that the boy is not with us, he will come to his death, and our father's grey head will go down in sorrow to the underworld.\\n32 For I made myself responsible for the boy to my father, saying, If I do not give him safely back to you, let mine be the sin for ever.\\n33 So now let me be my lord's servant here in place of the boy, and let him go back with his brothers.\\n34 For how may I go back to my father without the boy, and see the evil which will come on my father?\\n</td>\n",

So now let me go and put my father in his last resting-place, and I will come back again.\\n6 And Pharaoh said, Go up and put your father to rest, as you gave your oath to him.\\n7 So Joseph went up to put his father in his last resting-place; and with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, and the chief men of his house and all the chiefs of the land of Egypt,\\n8 And all the family of Joseph, and his brothers and his father's people: only their little ones and their flocks and herds they did not take with them from the land of Goshen.\\n9 And carriages went up with him and horsemen, a great army.\\n10 And they came to the grain-floor of Atad on the other side of Jordan, and there they gave the last honours to Jacob, with great and bitter sorrow, weeping for their father for seven days.\\n11 And when the people of the land, the people of Canaan, at the grain-floor of Atad, saw their grief, they said, Great is the grief of the Egyptians: so the place was named Abel-mizraim, on the other side of Jordan.\\n12 So his sons did as he had given them orders to do:\\n13 For they took him into the land of Canaan and put him to rest in the hollow rock in the field of Machpelah, which Abraham got with the field, for a resting-place, from Ephron the Hittite at Mamre.\\n14 And when his father had been put to rest, Joseph and his brothers and all who had gone with him, went back to Egypt.\\n15 Now after the death of their father, Joseph's brothers said to themselves, It may be that Joseph's heart will be turned against us, and he will give us punishment for all the evil which we did to him.\\n16 So they sent word to Joseph, saying, Your father, before his death, gave us orders, saying,\\n17 You are to say to Joseph, Let the wrongdoing of your brothers be overlooked, and the evil they did to you: now, if it is your pleasure, let the sin of the servants of your father's God have forgiveness. And at these words, Joseph was overcome with weeping.\\n18 Then his brothers went, and falling at his feet, said, Truly, we are your servants.\\n19 And Joseph said, Have no fear: am I in the place of God?\\n20 As for you, it was in your mind to do me evil, but God has given a happy outcome, the salvation of numbers of people, as you see today.\\n21 So now, have no fear: for I will take care of you and your little ones. So he gave them comfort with kind words.\\n22 Now Joseph and all his father's family went on living in Egypt: and the years of Joseph's life were a hundred and ten.\\n23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: and the children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, came to birth on Joseph's knees.\\n24 Then Joseph said to his brothers, The time of my death has come; but God will keep you in mind and take you out of this land into the land which he gave by his oath to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.\\n25 Then Joseph made the children of Israel take an oath, saying, God will certainly give effect to his word, and you are to take my bones away from here.\\n26 So Joseph came to his death, being a hundred and ten years old: and they made his body ready, and he was put in a chest in Egypt.\\n</td>\n",

And they came near, And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom you sent into Egypt.\\n5 Now do not be troubled or angry with yourselves for sending me away, because God sent me before you to be the saviour of your lives.\\n6 For these two years have been years of need, and there are still five more years to come in which there will be no ploughing or cutting of grain.\\n7 God sent me before you to keep you and yours living on earth so that you might become a great nation.\\n8 So now it was not you who sent me here, but God: and he has made me as a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.\\n9 Now go quickly to my father, and say to him, Your son Joseph says, God has made me ruler over all the land of Egypt: come down to me straight away:\\n10 The land of Goshen will be your living-place, and you will be near me; you and your children and your children's children, and your flocks and herds and all you have:\\n11 And there I will take care of you, so that you and your family may not be in need, for there are still five bad years to come.\\n12 Now truly, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth which says these things to you.\\n13 Give my father word of all my glory in Egypt and of all you have seen; and come back quickly with my father.\\n14 Then, weeping, he took Benjamin in his arms, and Benjamin himself was weeping on Joseph's neck.\\n15 Then he gave a kiss to all his brothers, weeping over them; and after that his brothers had no fear of talking to him.\\n16 And news of these things went through Pharaoh's house, and it was said that Joseph's brothers were come; and it seemed good to Pharaoh and his servants.\\n17 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to your brothers, Put your goods on your beasts and go back to the land of Canaan;\\n18 And get your father and your families and come back to me: and I will give you all the good things of Egypt, and the fat of the land will be your food.\\n19 And say to them, This you are to do: take carts from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and get your father and come back.\\n20 And take no thought for your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.\\n21 And the children of Israel did as he said; and Joseph gave them carts as had been ordered by Pharaoh, and food for their journey.\\n22 To every one of them he gave three changes of clothing; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred bits of silver and five changes of clothing.\\n23 And to his father he sent ten asses with good things from Egypt on their backs, and ten she-asses with grain and bread and food for his father on the journey.\\n24 And he sent his brothers on their way, and said to them, See that you have no argument on the road.\\n25 So they went up from Egypt and came to the land of Canaan, to their father Jacob.\\n26 And they said to him, Joseph is living, and is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And at this word Jacob was quite overcome, for he had no faith in it.\\n27 And they gave him an account of everything Joseph had said to them; and when he saw the carts which Joseph had sent for them, his spirit came back to him:\\n28 And Israel said, It is enough: Joseph my son is still living; I will go and see him before my death.\\n</td>\n",

Then Pharaoh came out of his sleep.\\n5 But he went to sleep again and had a second dream, in which he saw seven heads of grain, full and good, all on one stem.\\n6 And after them came up seven other heads, thin and wasted by the east wind.\\n7 And the seven thin heads made a meal of the good heads. And when Pharaoh was awake he saw it was a dream.\\n8 And in the morning his spirit was troubled; and he sent for all the wise men of Egypt and all the holy men, and put his dream before them, but no one was able to give him the sense of it.\\n9 Then the chief wine-servant said to Pharaoh, The memory of my sin comes back to me now;\\n10 Pharaoh had been angry with his servants, and had put me in prison in the house of the captain of the army, together with the chief bread-maker;\\n11 And we had a dream on the same night, the two of us, and the dreams had a special sense.\\n12 And there was with us a young Hebrew, the captain's servant, and when we put our dreams before him, he gave us the sense of them.\\n13 And it came about as he said: I was put back in my place, and the bread-maker was put to death by hanging.\\n14 Then Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and they took him quickly out of prison; and when his hair had been cut and his dress changed, he came before Pharaoh.\\n15 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have had a dream, and no one is able to give me the sense of it; now it has come to my ears that you are able to give the sense of a dream when it is put before you.\\n16 Then Joseph said, Without God there will be no answer of peace for Pharaoh.\\n17 Then Pharaoh said, In my dream I was by the side of the Nile:\\n18 And out of the Nile came seven cows, fat and good-looking, and their food was the river-grass;\\n19 Then after them came seven other cows, very thin and poor-looking, worse than any I ever saw in the land of Egypt;\\n20 And the thin cows made a meal of the seven fat cows who came up first;\\n21 And even with the fat cows inside them they seemed as bad as before. And so I came out of my sleep.\\n22 And again in a dream I saw seven heads of grain, full and good, coming up on one stem:\\n23 And then I saw seven other heads, dry, thin, and wasted by the east wind, coming up after them:\\n24 And the seven thin heads made a meal of the seven good heads; and I put this dream before the wise men, but not one of them was able to give me the sense of it.\\n25 Then Joseph said, These two dreams have the same sense: God has made clear to Pharaoh what he is about to do.\\n26 The seven fat cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years: the two have the same sense.\\n27 The seven thin and poor-looking cows who came up after them are seven years; and the seven heads of grain, dry and wasted by the east wind, are seven years when there will be no food.\\n28 As I said to Pharaoh before, God has made clear to him what he is about to do.\\n29 Seven years are coming in which there will be great wealth of grain in Egypt;\\n30 And after that will come seven years when there will not be enough food; and the memory of the good years will go from men's minds; and the land will be made waste by the bad years;\\n31 And men will have no memory of the good time because of the need which will come after, for it will be very bitter.\\n32 And this dream came to Pharaoh twice, because this thing is certain, and God will quickly make it come about.\\n33 And now let Pharaoh make search for a man of wisdom and good sense, and put him in authority over the land of Egypt.\\n34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him put overseers over the land of Egypt to put in store a fifth part of the produce of the land in the good years.\\n35 And let them get together all the food in those good years and make a store of grain under Pharaoh's control for the use of the towns, and let them keep it.\\n36 And let that food be kept in store for the land till the seven bad years which are to come in Egypt; so that the land may not come to destruction through need of food.\\n37 And this seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants.\\n38 Then Pharaoh said to his servants, Where may we get such a man as this, a man in whom is the spirit of God?\\n39 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Seeing that God has made all this clear to you, there is no other man of such wisdom and good sense as you:\\n40 You, then, are to be over my house, and all my people will be ruled by your word: only as king will I be greater than you.\\n41 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have put you over all the land of Egypt.\\n42 Then Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and he had him clothed with the best linen, and put a chain of gold round his neck;\\n43 And he made him take his seat in the second of his carriages; and they went before him crying, Make way! So he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.\\n44 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh; and without your order no man may do anything in all the land of Egypt.\\n45 And Pharaoh gave Joseph the name of Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera, the priest of On, to be his wife. So Joseph went through all the land of Egypt.\\n46 Now Joseph was thirty years old when he came before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from before the face of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt.\\n47 Now in the seven good years the earth gave fruit in masses.\\n48 And Joseph got together all the food of those seven years, and made a store of food in the towns: the produce of the fields round every town was stored up in the town.\\n49 So he got together a store of grain like the sand of the sea; so great a store that after a time he gave up measuring it, for it might not be measured.\\n50 And before the time of need, Joseph had two sons, to whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera, priest of On, gave birth.\\n51 And to the first he gave the name Manasseh, for he said, God has taken away from me all memory of my hard life and of my father's house.\\n52 And to the second he gave the name Ephraim, for he said, God has given me fruit in the land of my sorrow.\\n53 And so the seven good years in Egypt came to an end.\\n54 Then came the first of the seven years of need as Joseph had said: and in every other land they were short of food; but in the land of Egypt there was bread.\\n55 And when all the land of Egypt was in need of food, the people came crying to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to the people, Go to Joseph, and whatever he says to you, do it.\\n56 And everywhere on the earth they were short of food; then Joseph, opening all his store-houses, gave the people of Egypt grain for money; so great was the need of food in the land of Egypt.\\n57 And all lands sent to Egypt, to Joseph, to get grain, for the need was great over all the earth.\\n</td>\n",

And they said, From the land of Canaan, to get food.\\n8 Now though Joseph saw that these were his brothers, they had no idea who he was.\\n9 Then the memory of his dreams about them came back to Joseph, and he said to them, You have come secretly to see how poor the land is.\\n10 And they said to him, Not so, my lord: your servants have come with money to get food.\\n11 We are all one man's sons, we are true men; we have not come with any secret purpose.\\n12 And he said to them, No, but you have come to see how poor the land is.\\n13 Then they said, We your servants are twelve brothers, sons of one man in the land of Canaan; the youngest of us is now with our father, and one is dead.\\n14 And Joseph said, It is as I said; you have come with some secret purpose;\\n15 But in this way will you be put to the test: by the life of Pharaoh, you will not go away from this place till your youngest brother comes here.\\n16 Send one of your number to get your brother, and the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are true; if not, by the life of Pharaoh, your purpose is certainly secret.\\n17 So he put them in prison for three days.\\n18 And on the third day Joseph said to them, Do this, if you would keep your lives: for I am a god-fearing man:\\n19 If you are true men, let one of you be kept in prison, while you go and take grain for the needs of your families;\\n20 And come back to me with your youngest brother, so that your words may be seen to be true, and you will not be put to death. This is what you are to do.\\n21 And they said to one another, Truly, we did wrong to our brother, for we saw his grief of mind, and we did not give ear to his prayers; that is why this trouble has come on us.\\n22 And Reuben said to them, Did I not say to you, Do the child no wrong? but you gave no attention; so now, punishment has come on us for his blood.\\n23 They were not conscious that the sense of their words was clear to Joseph, for he had been talking to them through one who had knowledge of their language.\\n24 And turning away from them, he was overcome with weeping; then he went on talking to them again and took Simeon and put chains on him before their eyes.\\n25 Then Joseph gave orders for their bags to be made full of grain, and for every man's money to be put back into his bag, and for food to be given them for the journey: which was done.\\n26 Then they put the bags of grain on their asses and went away.\\n27 Now at their night's resting-place one of them, opening his bag to give his ass some food, saw his money in the mouth of the bag.\\n28 And he said to his brothers, My money has been given back: it is in my bag; then their hearts became full of fear, and turning to one another they said, What is this which God has done to us?\\n29 So when they came to Jacob their father, in the land of Canaan, they gave him an account of all their experiences, saying,\\n30 The man who is the ruler of the country was rough with us and put us in prison, saying that we had come with a secret evil purpose.\\n31 And we said to him, We are true men, we have no evil designs;\\n32 We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is dead, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan.\\n33 And the ruler of the land said, In this way I may be certain that you are true men; let one of you be kept here with me, while you go and take grain for the needs of your families;\\n34 And come back to me with your youngest brother: then I will be certain that you are true men, and I will give your brother back to you and let you do trade in the land.\\n35 And when they took the grain out of their bags, it was seen that every man's parcel of money was in his bag; and when they and their father saw the money, they were full of fear.\\n36 And Jacob their father said to them, You have taken my children from me: Joseph is gone and Simeon is gone, and now you would take Benjamin away; all these things have come on me.\\n37 And Reuben said, Put my two sons to death if I do not come back to you with him; let him be in my care and I will give him safely back to you.\\n38 And he said, I will not let my son go down with you; for his brother is dead and he is all I have: if evil overtakes him on the journey, then through you will my grey head go down to the underworld in sorrow.\\n</td>\n",

And Rachel said to her, Let me have some of your son's love-fruits.\\n15 But Leah said to her, Is it a small thing that you have taken my husband from me? and now would you take my son's love-fruits? Then Rachel said, You may have him tonight in exchange for your son's love-fruits.\\n16 In the evening, when Jacob came in from the field, Leah went out to him and said, Tonight you are to come to me, for I have given my son's love-fruits as a price for you. And he went in to her that night.\\n17 And God gave ear to her and she became with child, and gave Jacob a fifth son.\\n18 Then Leah said, God has made payment to me for giving my servant-girl to my husband: so she gave her son the name Issachar.\\n19 And again Leah became with child, and she gave Jacob a sixth son.\\n20 And she said, God has given me a good bride-price; now at last will I have my husband living with me, for I have given him six sons: and she gave him the name Zebulun.\\n21 After that she had a daughter, to whom she gave the name Dinah.\\n22 Then God gave thought to Rachel, and hearing her prayer he made her fertile.\\n23 And she was with child, and gave birth to a son: and she said, God has taken away my shame.\\n24 And she gave him the name Joseph, saying, May the Lord give me another son.\\n25 Now after the birth of Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, Let me go away to my place and my country.\\n26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have been your servant, and let me go: for you have knowledge of all the work I have done for you.\\n27 And Laban said, If you will let me say so, do not go away; for I have seen by the signs that the Lord has been good to me because of you.\\n28 Say then what your payment is to be and I will give it.\\n29 Then Jacob said, You have seen what I have done for you, and how your cattle have done well under my care.\\n30 For before I came you had little, and it has been greatly increased; and the Lord has given you a blessing in everything I have done; but when am I to do something for my family?\\n31 And Laban said, What am I to give you? And Jacob said, Do not give me anything; but I will again take up the care of your flock if you will only do this for me:\\n32 Let me go through all your flock today, taking out from among them all the sheep which are marked or coloured or black, and all the marked or coloured goats: these will be my payment.\\n33 And so you will be able to put my honour to the test in time to come; if you see among my flocks any goats which are not marked or coloured, or any sheep which is not black, you may take me for a thief.\\n34 And Laban said, Let it be as you say.\\n35 So that day he took all the he-goats which were banded or coloured, and all the she-goats which were marked or coloured or had white marks, and all the black sheep, and gave them into the care of his sons;\\n36 And sent them three days' journey away: and Jacob took care of the rest of Laban's flock.\\n37 Then Jacob took young branches of trees, cutting off the skin so that the white wood was seen in bands.\\n38 And he put the banded sticks in the drinking-places where the flock came to get water; and they became with young when they came to the water.\\n39 And because of this, the flock gave birth to young which were marked with bands of colour.\\n40 These lambs Jacob kept separate; and he put his flock in a place by themselves and not with Laban's flock.\\n41 And whenever the stronger ones of the flock became with young, Jacob put the sticks in front of them in the drinking-places, so that they might become with young when they saw the sticks.\\n42 But when the flocks were feeble, he did not put the sticks before them; so that the feebler flocks were Laban's and the stronger were Jacob's.\\n43 So Jacob's wealth was greatly increased; he had great flocks and women-servants and men-servants and camels and asses.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>1 Now Abraham was old and far on in years: and the Lord had given him everything in full measure.\\n2 And Abraham said to his chief servant, the manager of all his property, Come now, put your hand under my leg:\\n3 And take an oath by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not get a wife for my son Isaac from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living;\\n4 But that you will go into my country and to my relations and get a wife there for my son Isaac.\\n5 And the servant said, If by chance the woman will not come with me into this land, am I to take your son back again to the land from which you came?\\n6 And Abraham said, Take care that you do not let my son go back to that land.\\n7 The Lord God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my birth, and made an oath to me, saying, To your seed I will give this land: he will send his angel before you and give you a wife for my son in that land.\\n8 And if the woman will not come with you, then you are free from this oath; only do not take my son back there.\\n9 And the servant put his hand under Abraham's leg, and gave him his oath about this thing.\\n10 And the servant took ten of his master's camels, and all sorts of good things of his master's, and went to Mesopotamia, to the town of Nahor.\\n11 And he made the camels take their rest outside the town by the water-spring in the evening, at the time when the women came to get water.\\n12 And he said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, let me do well in what I have undertaken this day, and give your mercy to my master Abraham.\\n13 See, I am waiting here by the water-spring; and the daughters of the town are coming out to get water:\\n14 Now, may the girl to whom I say, Let down your vessel and give me a drink, and who says in answer, Here is a drink for you and let me give water to your camels: may she be the one marked out by you for your servant Isaac: so may I be certain that you have been good to my master Abraham.\\n15 And even before his words were ended, Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, who was the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, came out with her water-vessel on her arm.\\n16 She was a very beautiful girl, a virgin, who had never been touched by a man: and she went down to the spring to get water in her vessel.\\n17 And the servant came running to her and said, Give me a little water from your vessel.\\n18 And she said, Take a drink, my lord: and quickly letting down her vessel onto her hand, she gave him a drink.\\n19 And having done so, she said, I will get water for your camels till they have had enough.\\n20 And after putting the water from her vessel into the animals' drinking-place, she went quickly back to the spring and got water for all the camels.\\n21 And the man, looking at her, said nothing, waiting to see if the Lord had given his journey a good outcome.\\n22 And when the camels had had enough, the man took a gold nose-ring, half a shekel in weight, and two ornaments for her arms of ten shekels weight of gold;\\n23 And said to her, Whose daughter are you? is there room in your father's house for us?\\n24 And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, Nahor's wife.\\n25 And she said, We have a great store of dry grass and cattle-food, and there is room for you.\\n26 And with bent head the man gave worship to the Lord;\\n27 And said, Praise be to the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who has given a sign that he is good and true to my master, by guiding me straight to the house of my master's family.\\n28 So the girl went running and took the news of these things to her mother's house\\n29 Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he came out quickly to the man at the water-spring.\\n30 And when he saw the nose-ring and the ornaments on his sister's hands, and when she gave him word of what the man had said to her, then he went out to the man who was waiting with the camels by the water-spring.\\n31 And he said to him, Come in, you on whom is the blessing of the Lord; why are you waiting outside? for I have made the house ready for you, and a place for the camels.\\n32 Then the man came into the house, and Laban took their cords off the camels and gave them dry grass and food, and he gave to him and the men who were with him water for washing their feet.\\n33 And meat was put before him, but he said, I will not take food till I have made my business clear to you. And they said, Do so.\\n34 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.\\n35 The Lord has given my master every blessing, and he has become great: he has given him flocks and herds and silver and gold, and men-servants and women-servants and camels and asses.\\n36 And when Sarah, my master's wife, was old, she gave birth to a son, to whom he has given all he has.\\n37 And my master made me take an oath, saying, Do not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living;\\n38 But go to my father's house and to my relations for a wife for my son.\\n39 And I said to my master, What if the woman will not come with me?\\n40 And he said, The Lord, whom I have ever kept before me, will send his angel with you, who will make it possible for you to get a wife for my son from my relations and my father's house;\\n41 And you will be free from your oath to me when you come to my people; and if they will not give her to you, you will be free from your oath.\\n42 And I came today to the water-spring, and I said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, if it is your purpose to give a good outcome to my journey,\\n43 Let it come about that, while I am waiting here by the water-spring, if a girl comes to get water and I say to her, Give me a little water from your vessel, and she says,\\n44 Take a drink, and I will get water for your camels; let her be the woman marked out by the Lord for my master's son.\\n45 And even while I was saying this to myself, Rebekah came out with her vessel on her arm; and she went down to the spring to get water; and I said to her, Give me a drink.\\n46 And straight away she took down her vessel from her arm, and said, Take a drink, and I will get water for your camels.\\n47 And questioning her, I said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, the son of Nahor, and Milcah his wife. Then I put the ring on her nose and the ornaments on her hands.\\n48 And with bent head I gave worship and praise to the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, by whom I had been guided in the right way, to get the daughter of my master's brother for his son.\\n49 And now, say if you will do what is good and right for my master or not, in order that it may be clear to me what I have to do.\\n50 Then Laban and Bethuel said in answer, This is the Lord's doing: it is not for us to say Yes or No to you.\\n51 See, here is Rebekah: take her and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as the Lord has said.\\n52 And at these words, Abraham's servant went down on his face and gave praise to the Lord.\\n53 Then he took jewels of silver and jewels of gold and fair robes and gave them to Rebekah: and he gave things of value to her mother and her brother.\\n54 Then he and the men who were with him had food and drink, and took their rest there that night; and in the morning he got up, and said, Let me now go back to my master.\\n55 But her brother and her mother said, Let the girl be with us a week or ten days, and then she may go.\\n56 And he said, Do not keep me; the Lord has given a good outcome to my journey; let me now go back to my master.\\n57 And they said, We will send for the girl, and let her make the decision.\\n58 And they sent for Rebekah and said to her, Are you ready to go with this man? And she said, I am ready.\\n59 So they sent their sister Rebekah and her servant with Abraham's servant and his men.\\n60 And they gave Rebekah their blessing, saying, O sister, may you be the mother of thousands and ten thousands; and may your seed overcome all those who make war against them.\\n61 So Rebekah and her servant-women went with the man, seated on the camels; and so the servant took Rebekah and went on his way.\\n62 Now Isaac had come through the waste land to Beer-lahai-roi; for he was living in the South.\\n63 And when the evening was near, he went wandering out into the fields, and lifting up his eyes he saw camels coming.\\n64 And when Rebekah, looking up, saw Isaac, she got down from her camel,\\n65 And said to the servant, Who is that man coming to us through the field? And the servant said, It is my master: then she took her veil, covering her face with it.\\n66 Then the servant gave Isaac the story of all he had done.\\n67 And Isaac took Rebekah into his tent and she became his wife; and in his love for her, Isaac was comforted after his father's death.\\n</td>\n",

And they said, Let it be so.\\n6 Then Abraham went quickly into the tent, and said to Sarah, Get three measures of meal straight away and make cakes.\\n7 And running to the herd, he took a young ox, soft and fat, and gave it to the servant and he quickly made it ready;\\n8 And he took butter and milk and the young ox which he had made ready and put it before them, waiting by them under the tree while they took food.\\n9 And they said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? And he said, She is in the tent.\\n10 And he said, I will certainly come back to you in the spring, and Sarah your wife will have a son. And his words came to the ears of Sarah who was at the back of the tent-door.\\n11 Now Abraham and Sarah were very old, and Sarah was past the time for giving birth.\\n12 And Sarah, laughing to herself, said, Now that I am used up am I still to have pleasure, my husband himself being old?\\n13 And the Lord said, Why was Sarah laughing and saying, Is it possible for me, being old, to give birth to a child?\\n14 Is there any wonder which the Lord is not able to do? At the time I said, in the spring, I will come back to you, and Sarah will have a child.\\n15 Then Sarah said, I was not laughing; for she was full of fear. And he said, No, but you were laughing.\\n16 And the men went on from there in the direction of Sodom; and Abraham went with them on their way.\\n17 And the Lord said, Am I to keep back from Abraham the knowledge of what I do;\\n18 Seeing that Abraham will certainly become a great and strong nation, and his name will be used by all the nations of the earth as a blessing?\\n19 For I have made him mine so that he may give orders to his children and those of his line after him, to keep the ways of the Lord, to do what is good and right: so that the Lord may do to Abraham as he has said.\\n20 And the Lord said, Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is very great, and their sin is very evil,\\n21 I will go down now, and see if their acts are as bad as they seem from the outcry which has come to me; and if they are not, I will see.\\n22 And the men, turning from that place, went on to Sodom: but Abraham was still waiting before the Lord.\\n23 And Abraham came near, and said, Will you let destruction come on the upright with the sinners?\\n24 If by chance there are fifty upright men in the town, will you give the place to destruction and not have mercy on it because of the fifty upright men?\\n25 Let such a thing be far from you, to put the upright to death with the sinner: will not the judge of all the earth do right?\\n26 And the Lord said, If there are fifty upright men in the town, I will have mercy on it because of them.\\n27 And Abraham answering said, Truly, I who am only dust, have undertaken to put my thoughts before the Lord:\\n28 If by chance there are five less than fifty upright men, will you give up all the town to destruction because of these five? And he said, I will not give it to destruction if there are forty-five.\\n29 And again he said to him, By chance there may be forty there. And he said, I will not do it if there are forty.\\n30 And he said, Let not the Lord be angry with me if I say, What if there are thirty there? And he said, I will not do it if there are thirty.\\n31 And he said, See now, I have undertaken to put my thoughts before the Lord: what if there are twenty there? And he said, I will have mercy because of the twenty.\\n32 And he said, O let not the Lord be angry and I will say only one word more: by chance there may be ten there. And he said, I will have mercy because of the ten.\\n33 And the Lord went on his way when his talk with Abraham was ended, and Abraham went back to his place.\\n</td>\n",

And they said, Not so, but we will take our night's rest in the street.\\n3 But he made his request more strongly, so they went with him into his house; and he got food ready for them, and made unleavened bread, of which they took.\\n4 But before they had gone to bed, the men of the town, all the men of Sodom, came round the house, young and old, from every part of the town;\\n5 And crying out to Lot, they said, Where are the men who came to your house this night? Send them out to us, so that we may take our pleasure with them.\\n6 And Lot went out to them in the doorway, shutting the door after him.\\n7 And he said, My brothers, do not this evil.\\n8 See now, I have two unmarried daughters; I will send them out to you so that you may do to them whatever seems good to you: only do nothing to these men, for this is why they have come under the shade of my roof.\\n9 And they said, Give way there. This one man, they said, came here from a strange country, and will he now be our judge? now we will do worse to you than to them; and pushing violently against Lot, they came near to get the door broken in.\\n10 But the men put out their hands and took Lot into the house to them, shutting the door again.\\n11 But the men who were outside the door they made blind, all of them, small and great, so that they were tired out with looking for the door.\\n12 Then the men said to Lot, Are there any others of your family here? sons-in-law or sons or daughters, take them all out of this place;\\n13 For we are about to send destruction on this place, because a great outcry against them has come to the ears of the Lord; and the Lord has sent us to put an end to the town.\\n14 And Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were married to his daughters, Come, let us go out of this place, for the Lord is about to send destruction on the town. But his sons-in-law did not take him seriously.\\n15 And when morning came, the angels did all in their power to make Lot go, saying, Get up quickly and take your wife and your two daughters who are here, and go, for fear that you come to destruction in the punishment of the town.\\n16 But while he was waiting, the men took him and his wife and his daughters by the hand, for the Lord had mercy on them, and put them outside the town.\\n17 And when they had put them out, he said, Go for your life, without looking back or waiting in the lowland; go quickly to the mountain or you will come to destruction.\\n18 And Lot said to them, Not so, O my Lord;\\n19 See now, your servant has had grace in your eyes and great is your mercy in keeping my life from destruction, but I am not able to get as far as the mountain before evil overtakes me and death;\\n20 This town, now, is near, and it is a little one: O, let me go there (is it not a little one?) so that my life may be safe.\\n21 And he said, See, I have given you your request in this one thing more: I will not send destruction on this town.\\n22 Go there quickly, for I am not able to do anything till you have come there. For this reason, the town was named Zoar.\\n23 The sun was up when Lot came to Zoar.\\n24 Then the Lord sent fire and flaming smoke raining down from heaven on Sodom and Gomorrah.\\n25 And he sent destruction on those towns, with all the lowland and all the people of those towns and every green thing in the land.\\n26 But Lot's wife, looking back, became a pillar of salt.\\n27 And Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had been talking with the Lord:\\n28 And looking in the direction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the lowland, he saw the smoke of the land going up like the smoke of an oven.\\n29 So it came about that when God sent destruction on the towns of the lowland, he kept his word to Abraham, and sent Lot safely away when he put an end to the towns where he was living.\\n30 Then Lot went up out of Zoar to the mountain, and was living there with his two daughters, for fear kept him from living in Zoar: and he and his daughters made their living-place in a hole in the rock.\\n31 And the older daughter said to her sister, Our father is old, and there is no man to be a husband to us in the natural way:\\n32 Come, let us give our father much wine, and we will go into his bed, so that we may have offspring by our father,\\n33 And that night they made their father take much wine; and the older daughter went into his bed; and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away.\\n34 And on the day after, the older daughter said to the younger, Last night I was with my father; let us make him take much wine this night again, and do you go to him, so that we may have offspring by our father.\\n35 And that night again they made their father take much wine; and the younger daughter went into his bed; and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away.\\n36 And so the two daughters of Lot were with child by their father.\\n37 And the older daughter had a son, and she gave him the name Moab: he is the father of the Moabites to this day.\\n38 And the younger had a son and gave him the name Ben-ammi: from him come the children of Ammon to this day.\\n</td>\n",

And he said, I am.\\n25 And he said, Put it before me and I will take of my son's meat, so that I may give you a blessing. And he put it before him and he took it; and he gave him wine, and he had a drink.\\n26 And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, my son, and give me a kiss.\\n27 And he came near and gave him a kiss; and smelling the smell of his clothing, he gave him a blessing, and said, See, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field on which the blessing of the Lord has come:\\n28 May God give you the dew of heaven, and the good things of the earth, and grain and wine in full measure:\\n29 Let peoples be your servants, and nations go down before you: be lord over your brothers, and let your mother's sons go down before you: a curse be on everyone by whom you are cursed, and a blessing on those who give you a blessing.\\n30 And when Isaac had come to the end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had not long gone away from Isaac his father, Esau came in from the field.\\n31 And he made ready a meal, good to the taste, and took it to his father, and said to him, Let my father get up and take of his son's meat, so that you may give me a blessing.\\n32 And Isaac his father said to him, Who are you? And he said, I am your oldest son, Esau.\\n33 And in great fear Isaac said, Who then is he who got meat and put it before me, and I took it all before you came, and gave him a blessing, and his it will be?\\n34 And hearing the words of his father, Esau gave a great and bitter cry, and said to his father, Give a blessing to me, even to me, O my father!\\n35 And he said, Your brother came with deceit, and took away your blessing.\\n36 And he said, Is it because he is named Jacob that he has twice taken my place? for he took away my birthright, and now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you not kept a blessing for me?\\n37 And Isaac answering said, But I have made him your master, and have given him all his brothers for servants; I have made him strong with grain and wine: what then am I to do for you, my son?\\n38 And Esau said to his father, Is that the only blessing you have, my father? give a blessing to me, even me! And Esau was overcome with weeping.\\n39 Then Isaac his father made answer and said to him, Far from the fertile places of the earth, and far from the dew of heaven on high will your living-place be:\\n40 By your sword will you get your living and you will be your brother's servant; but when your power is increased his yoke will be broken from off your neck.\\n41 So Esau was full of hate for Jacob because of his father's blessing; and he said in his heart, The days of weeping for my father are near; then I will put my brother Jacob to death.\\n42 Then Rebekah, hearing what Esau had said, sent for Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, It seems that your brother Esau is purposing to put you to death.\\n43 So now, my son, do what I say: go quickly to Haran, to my brother Laban;\\n44 And be there with him for a little time, till your brother's wrath is turned away;\\n45 Till the memory of what you have done to him is past and he is no longer angry: then I will send word for you to come back; are the two of you to be taken from me in one day?\\n46 Then Rebekah said to Isaac, My life is a weariness to me because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob takes a wife from among the daughters of Heth, such as these, the women of this land, of what use will my life be to me?\\n</td>\n",

And he said to him, Here am I.\\n14 And he said to him, Go now, and see if your brothers are well and how the flock is; then come back and give me word. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.\\n15 And a man saw him wandering in the country, and said to him, What are you looking for?\\n16 And he said, I am looking for my brothers; please give me word of where they are keeping their flock.\\n17 And the man said, They have gone away from here, for they said in my hearing, Let us go to Dothan. So Joseph went after them and came up with them at Dothan.\\n18 But they saw him when he was a long way off, and before he came near them they made a secret design against him to put him to death;\\n19 Saying to one another, See, here comes this dreamer.\\n20 Let us now put him to death and put his body into one of these holes, and we will say, An evil beast has put him to death: then we will see what becomes of his dreams.\\n21 But Reuben, hearing these words, got him out of their hands, saying, Let us not take his life.\\n22 Do not put him to a violent death, but let him be placed in one of the holes; this he said to keep him safe from their hands, with the purpose of taking him back to his father again.\\n23 So when Joseph came to his brothers, they took off his long coat which he had on;\\n24 And they took him and put him in the hole: now the hole had no water in it.\\n25 Then seating themselves, they took their meal: and looking up, they saw a travelling band of Ishmaelites, coming from Gilead on their way to Egypt, with spices and perfumes on their camels.\\n26 And Judah said to his brothers, What profit is there in putting our brother to death and covering up his blood?\\n27 Let us give him to these Ishmaelites for a price, and let us not put violent hands on him, for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brothers gave ear to him.\\n28 And some traders from Midian went by; so pulling Joseph up out of the hole, they gave him to the Ishmaelites for twenty bits of silver, and they took him to Egypt.\\n29 Now when Reuben came back to the hole, Joseph was not there; and giving signs of grief,\\n30 He went back to his brothers, and said, The child is gone; what am I to do?\\n31 Then they took Joseph's coat, and put on it some of the blood from a young goat which they had put to death,\\n32 And they took the coat to their father, and said, We came across this; is it your son's coat or not?\\n33 And he saw that it was, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast has put him to death; without doubt Joseph has come to a cruel end.\\n34 Then Jacob, giving signs of grief, put on haircloth, and went on weeping for his son day after day.\\n35 And all his sons and all his daughters came to give him comfort, but he would not be comforted, saying with weeping, I will go down to the underworld to my son. So great was his father's sorrow for him.\\n36 And in Egypt the men of Midian gave him for a price to Potiphar, a captain of high position in Pharaoh's house.\\n</td>\n",

This was a foolish thing to do.\\n29 It is in my power to do you damage: but the God of your father came to me this night, saying, Take care that you say nothing good or bad to Jacob.\\n30 And now, it seems, you are going because your heart's desire is for your father's house; but why have you taken my gods?\\n31 And Jacob, in answer, said to Laban, My fear was that you might take your daughters from me by force.\\n32 As for your gods, if anyone of us has them, let him be put to death: make search before us all for what is yours, and take it. For Jacob had no knowledge that Rachel had taken them.\\n33 So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent, and into the tents of the two servant-women, but they were not there; and he came out of Leah's tent and went into Rachel's.\\n34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and had put them in the camels' basket, and was seated on them. And Laban, searching through all the tent, did not come across them.\\n35 And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry because I do not get up before you, for I am in the common condition of women. And with all his searching, he did not come across the images.\\n36 Then Jacob was angry with Laban, and said, What crime or sin have I done that you have come after me with such passion?\\n37 Now that you have made search through all my goods, what have you seen which is yours? Make it clear now before my people and your people, so that they may be judges between us.\\n38 These twenty years I have been with you; your sheep and your goats have had young without loss, not one of your he-goats have I taken for food.\\n39 Anything which was wounded by beasts I did not take to you, but myself made up for the loss of it; you made me responsible for whatever was taken by thieves, by day or by night.\\n40 This was my condition, wasted by heat in the day and by the bitter cold at night; and sleep went from my eyes.\\n41 These twenty years I have been in your house; I was your servant for fourteen years because of your daughters, and for six years I kept your flock, and ten times was my payment changed.\\n42 If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would have sent me away with nothing in my hands. But God has seen my troubles and the work of my hands, and this night he kept you back.\\n43 Then Laban, answering, said, These women are my daughters and these children my children, the flocks and all you see are mine: what now may I do for my daughters and for their children?\\n44 Come, let us make an agreement, you and I; and let it be for a witness between us.\\n45 Then Jacob took a stone and put it up as a pillar.\\n46 And Jacob said to his people, Get stones together; and they did so; and they had a meal there by the stones.\\n47 And the name Laban gave it was Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob gave it the name of Galeed.\\n48 And Laban said, These stones are a witness between you and me today. For this reason its name was Galeed,\\n49 And Mizpah, for he said, May the Lord keep watch on us when we are unable to see one another's doings.\\n50 If you are cruel to my daughters, or if you take other wives in addition to my daughters, then though no man is there to see, God will be the witness between us.\\n51 And Laban said, See these stones and this pillar which I have put between you and me;\\n52 They will be witness that I will not go over these stones to you, and you will not go over these stones or this pillar to me, for any evil purpose.\\n53 May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, be our judge. Then Jacob took an oath by the Fear of his father Isaac.\\n54 And Jacob made an offering on the mountain, and gave orders to his people to take food: so they had a meal and took their rest that night on the mountain.\\n55 And early in the morning Laban, after kissing and blessing his daughters, went on his way back to his country.\\n</td>\n",

So Tamar went back to her father's house.\\n12 And after a time, Bath-shua, Judah's wife, came to her end; and after Judah was comforted for her loss, he went to Timnah, where they were cutting the wool of his sheep, and his friend Hirah of Adullam went with him.\\n13 And when Tamar had news that her father-in-law was going up to Timnah to the wool-cutting,\\n14 She took off her widow's clothing, and covering herself with her veil, she took her seat near Enaim on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was now a man, but she had not been made his wife.\\n15 When Judah saw her he took her to be a loose woman of the town, because her face was covered.\\n16 And turning to her by the roadside, he said to her, Let me come in to you; for he had no idea that she was his daughter-in-law.

And they said, There was no such woman there.\\n22 So he went back to Judah, and said, I have not seen her, and the men of the place say that there is no such woman there.\\n23 And Judah said, Let her keep the things, so that we may not be shamed; I sent the young goat, but you did not see the woman.\\n24 Now about three months after this, word came to Judah that Tamar, his daughter-in-law, had been acting like a loose woman and was with child. And Judah said, Take her out and let her be burned.\\n25 And while she was being taken out, she sent word to her father-in-law, saying, The man whose property these things are, is the father of my child: say then, whose are this ring and this cord and this stick?\\n26 Then Judah said openly that they were his, and said, She is more upright than I am, for I did not give her to Shelah my son. And he had no more connection with her.\\n27 And when the time came for her to give birth, it was clear that there were two children in her body.\\n28 And while she was in the act of giving birth, one of them put out his hand; and the woman who was with her put a red thread round his hand, saying, This one came out first.\\n29 But then he took his hand back again, and his brother came first to birth: and the woman said, What an opening you have made for yourself!

Make your hands clean, you evil-doers; put away deceit from your hearts, you false in mind.\\n9 Be troubled, with sorrow and weeping; let your laughing be turned to sorrow and your joy to grief.\\n10 Make yourselves low in the eyes of the Lord and you will be lifted up by him.\\n11 Do not say evil against one another, my brothers. He who says evil against his brother or makes himself his brother's judge, says evil against the law and is judging the law: and in judging the law you become, not a doer of the law but a judge.\\n12 There is only one judge and law-giver, even he who has the power of salvation and of destruction; but who are you to be your neighbour's judge?\\n13 How foolish it is to say, Today or tomorrow we will go into this town, and be there for a year and do business there and get wealth:\\n14 When you are not certain what will take place tomorrow. What is your life? It is a mist, which is seen for a little time and then is gone.\\n15 But the right thing to say would be, If it is the Lord's pleasure and if we are still living, we will do this and that.\\n16 But now you go on glorying in your pride: and all such glorying is evil.\\n17 The man who has knowledge of how to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.\\n</td>\n",

If any man has love for the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\\n16 Because everything in the world, the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father but of the world.\\n17 And the world and its desires is coming to an end: but he who does God's pleasure is living for ever.\\n18 Little children, it is the last hour; and as you were given word that the Antichrist would come, so now a number of Antichrists have come to you; and by this we are certain that it is the last hour.\\n19 They went out from us but they were not of us; if they had been of us they would still be with us: but they went out from us so that it might be made clear that they were not of us.\\n20 And you have the Spirit from the Holy One and you all have knowledge.\\n21 I have not sent you this letter because you have no knowledge of what is true, but because you have knowledge, and because that which is false has nothing in common with that which is true.\\n22 Who is false but he who says that Jesus is not the Christ? He is the Antichrist who has no belief in the Father or the Son.\\n23 He who has no belief in the Son has not the Father: he who makes clear his belief in the Son has the Father.\\n24 But as for you, keep in your hearts the things which were made clear to you from the first. If you keep these things in your hearts you will be kept in the Father and the Son.\\n25 And this is the hope which he gave you, even eternal life.\\n26 I am writing these things to you about those whose purpose is that you may be turned out of the true way.\\n27 As for you, the Spirit which he gave you is still in you, and you have no need of any teacher; but as his Spirit gives you teaching about all things, and is true and not false, so keep your hearts in him, through the teaching which he has given you.\\n28 And now, my children, keep your hearts in him; so that at his revelation, we may have no fear or shame before him at his coming.\\n29 If you have knowledge that he is upright, it is clear to you that everyone who does righteousness is his offspring.\\n</td>\n",

This is the law which was given to you from the first, so that you might keep it.\\n7 Because a number of false teachers have gone out into the world, who do not give witness that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. Such a one is a false teacher and Antichrist.\\n8 Keep watch over yourselves, so that you do not make our work of no effect, but may get your full reward.\\n9 Anyone who goes on and does not keep to the teaching of Christ, has not God: he who keeps to the teaching has the Father and the Son.\\n10 If anyone comes to you not having this teaching, do not take him into your house or give him words of love:\\n11 For he who gives him words of love has a part in his evil works.\\n12 Having much to say to you, it is not my purpose to put it all down with paper and ink: but I am hoping to come to you, and to have talk with you face to face, so that your joy may be full.\\n13 The children of your noble sister, who is of God's selection, send you their love.\\n</td>\n",

They have gone in the way of Cain, running uncontrolled into the error of Balaam for reward, and have come to destruction by saying evil against the Lord, like Korah.\\n12 These men are unseen rocks at your love-feasts, when they take part in them with you, keepers of sheep who without fear take the food of the sheep; clouds without water rushing before the wind, wasted trees without fruit, twice dead, pulled up by the roots,\\n13 Violent waves of the sea, streaming with their shame, wandering stars for whom the darkest night is kept in store for ever.\\n14 The prophet Enoch, who was the seventh after Adam, said of these men, The Lord came with tens of thousands of his saints,\\n15 To be the judge of all, and to give a decision against all those whose lives are unpleasing to him, because of the evil acts which they have done, and because of all the hard things which sinners without fear of God have said against him.\\n16 These are the men who make trouble, ever desiring change, going after evil pleasures, using high-sounding words, respecting men's position in the hope of reward.\\n17 But you, my loved ones, keep in memory the words which were said before by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,\\n18 How they said to you, In the last days there will be men who, guided by their evil desires, will make sport of holy things.\\n19 These are the men who make divisions, natural men, not having the Spirit.\\n20 But you, my loved ones, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, and making prayers in the Holy Spirit,\\n21 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for life eternal through the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ.\\n22 And have pity on those who are in doubt;\\n23 And to some give salvation, pulling them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear, hating even the clothing which is made unclean by the flesh.\\n24 Now to him who is able to keep you from falling, and to give you a place in his glory, free from all evil, with great joy,\\n25 To the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, let us give glory and honour and authority and power, before all time and now and for ever.

       "0     1 Now the land was in bitter need of food.\\n2 And when the grain which they had got in Egypt was all used up, their father said to them, Go again and get us a little food.\\n3 And Judah said to him, The man said to us with an oath, You are not to come before me again without your brother.\\n4 If you will let our brother go with us, we will go down and get food:\\n5 But if you will not send him, we will not go down: for the man said to us, You are not to come before me if your brother is not with you.\\n6 And Israel said, Why were you so cruel to me as to say to him that you had a brother?\\n7 And they said, The man put a number of questions to us about ourselves and our family, saying, Is your father still living? have you another brother? And we had to give him answers; how were we to have any idea that he would say, Come back with your brother?\\n8 Then Judah said to Israel, his father, Send the boy with me, and let us be up and going, so that we and you and our little ones may not come to destruction.\\n9 Put him into my care and make me responsible for him: if I do not give him safely back to you, let mine be the sin for ever.\\n10 Truly, if we had not let the time go by, we might have come back again by now.\\n11 Then their father Israel said to them, If it has to be so, then do this: take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels to give the man, perfumes and honey and spices and nuts:\\n12 And take twice as much money with you; that is to say, take back the money which was put in your bags, for it may have been an error;\\n13 And take your brother and go back to the man:\\n14 And may God, the Ruler of all, give you mercy before the man, so that he may give you back your other brother and Benjamin. If my children are to be taken from me; there is no help for it.\\n15 So they took what their father said for the man, and twice as much money in their hands, and Benjamin, and went on their journey to Egypt, and came before Joseph.\\n16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin, he said to his chief servant, Take these men into my house, and make ready a meal, for they will take food with me in the middle of the day.\\n17 And the servant did as Joseph said, and took the men into Joseph's house.\\n18 Now the men were full of fear because they had been taken into Joseph's house and they said, It is because of the money which was put back in our bags the first time; he is looking for something against us, so that he may come down on us and take us and our asses for his use.\\n19 So they went up to Joseph's chief servant at the door of the house,\\n20 And said, O my lord, we only came down the first time to get food;\\n21 And when we came to our night's resting-place, on opening our bags we saw that every man's money was in the mouth of his bag, all our money in full weight: and we have it with us to give it back;\\n22 As well as more money, with which to get food: we have no idea who put our money in our bags.\\n23 Then the servant said, Peace be with you: have no fear: your God, even the God of your father, has put wealth in your bags for you: I had your money. Then he let Simeon come out to them.\\n24 And the servant took them into Joseph's house, and gave them water for washing their feet; and he gave their asses food.\\n25 And they got ready the things for Joseph before he came in the middle of the day: for word was given to them that they were to have a meal there.\\n26 And when Joseph came in, they gave him the things which they had for him, and went down to the earth before him.\\n27 And he said, How are you? is your father well, the old man of whom you were talking to me? is he still living?\\n28 And they said, Your servant, our father, is well, he is still living. And they went down on their faces before him.\\n29 Then, lifting up his eyes, he saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother's son, and he said, Is this your youngest brother of whom you gave me word? And he said, God be good to you, my son.\\n30 Then Joseph's heart went out to his brother, and he went quickly into his room, for he was overcome with weeping.\\n31 Then, after washing his face, he came out, and controlling his feelings said, Put food before us.\\n32 And they put a meal ready for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who were with him by themselves; because the Egyptians may not take food with the Hebrews, for that would make them unclean.\\n33 And they were all given their seats before him in order of birth, from the oldest to the youngest: so that they were looking at one another in wonder.\\n34 And Joseph sent food to them from his table, but he sent five times as much to Benjamin as to any of the others. And they took wine freely with him.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "1     1 Then he gave orders to the servant who was over his house, saying, Put as much food into the men's bags as will go into them, and put every man's money in the mouth of his bag;\\n2 And put my cup, my silver cup, in the youngest one's bag, with his money. So he did as Joseph said.\\n3 And at dawn the men, with their asses, were sent away.\\n4 And when they had gone only a little way out of the town, Joseph said to the servant who was over his house, Go after them; and when you overtake them, say to them, Why have you done evil in reward for good?\\n5 Is not this the cup from which my lord takes wine and by which he gets knowledge of the future? Truly, you have done evil.\\n6 So he overtook them and said these words to them.\\n7 And they said to him, Why does my lord say such words as these? far be it from your servants to do such a thing:\\n8 See, the money which was in the mouth of our bags we gave back to you when we came again from Canaan: how then might we take silver or gold from your lord's house?\\n9 If it comes to light that any of your servants has done this, let him be put to death, and we will be your lord's servants.\\n10 And he said, Let it be as you say: he in whose bag it is seen will become my servant; and you will not be responsible.\\n11 Then every man quickly got his bag down and undid it.\\n12 And he made a search, starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was in Benjamin's bag.\\n13 Then in bitter grief they put the bags on the asses again and went back to the town.\\n14 So Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house; and he was still there: and they went down on their faces before him.\\n15 And Joseph said, What is this thing which you have done? had you no thought that such a man as I would have power to see what is secret?\\n16 And Judah said, What are we to say to my lord? how may we put ourselves right in his eyes? God has made clear the sin of your servants: now we are in your hands, we and the man in whose bag your cup was seen.\\n17 Then he said, Far be it from me to do so: but the man who had my cup will be my servant; and you may go back to your father in peace.\\n18 Then Judah came near him, and said, Let your servant say a word in my lord's ears, and let not your wrath be burning against your servant: for you are in the place of Pharaoh to us.\\n19 My lord said to his servants, Have you a father or a brother?\\n20 And we said to my lord, We have an old father and a young child, whom he had when he was old; his brother is dead and he is the only son of his mother, and is very dear to his father.\\n21 And you said to your servants, Let him come down to me with you, so that I may see him.\\n22 And we said to my lord, His father will not let him go; for if he went away his father would come to his death.\\n23 But you said to your servants, If your youngest brother does not come with you, you will not see my face again.\\n24 And when we went back to your servant, our father, we gave him an account of my lord's words.\\n25 And our father said, Go again and get us a little food.\\n26 And we said, Only if our youngest brother goes with us will we go down; for we may not see the man's face again if our youngest brother is not with us.\\n27 And our father said to us, You have knowledge that my wife gave me two sons;\\n28 The one went away from me, and I said, Truly he has come to a violent death; and from that time I have not seen him,\\n29 If now you take this one from me, and some evil comes to him, you will make my grey head go down in sorrow to the underworld.\\n30 If then I go back to your servant, my father, without the boy, because his life and the boy's life are one,\\n31 When he sees that the boy is not with us, he will come to his death, and our father's grey head will go down in sorrow to the underworld.\\n32 For I made myself responsible for the boy to my father, saying, If I do not give him safely back to you, let mine be the sin for ever.\\n33 So now let me be my lord's servant here in place of the boy, and let him go back with his brothers.\\n34 For how may I go back to my father without the boy, and see the evil which will come on my father?\\n

       "2     1 And Joseph put his head down on his father's face, weeping and kissing him.\\n2 And Joseph gave orders to his servants who had the necessary knowledge, to make his father's body ready, folding it in linen with spices, and they did so.\\n3 And the forty days needed for making the body ready went by: and there was weeping for him among the Egyptians for seventy days.\\n4 And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph said to the servants of Pharaoh, If now you have love for me, say these words to Pharaoh:\\n5 My father made me take an oath, saying, When I am dead, put me to rest in the place I have made ready for myself in the land of Canaan. So now let me go and put my father in his last resting-place, and I will come back again.\\n6 And Pharaoh said, Go up and put your father to rest, as you gave your oath to him.\\n7 So Joseph went up to put his father in his last resting-place; and with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, and the chief men of his house and all the chiefs of the land of Egypt,\\n8 And all the family of Joseph, and his brothers and his father's people: only their little ones and their flocks and herds they did not take with them from the land of Goshen.\\n9 And carriages went up with him and horsemen, a great army.\\n10 And they came to the grain-floor of Atad on the other side of Jordan, and there they gave the last honours to Jacob, with great and bitter sorrow, weeping for their father for seven days.\\n11 And when the people of the land, the people of Canaan, at the grain-floor of Atad, saw their grief, they said, Great is the grief of the Egyptians: so the place was named Abel-mizraim, on the other side of Jordan.\\n12 So his sons did as he had given them orders to do:\\n13 For they took him into the land of Canaan and put him to rest in the hollow rock in the field of Machpelah, which Abraham got with the field, for a resting-place, from Ephron the Hittite at Mamre.\\n14 And when his father had been put to rest, Joseph and his brothers and all who had gone with him, went back to Egypt.\\n15 Now after the death of their father, Joseph's brothers said to themselves, It may be that Joseph's heart will be turned against us, and he will give us punishment for all the evil which we did to him.\\n16 So they sent word to Joseph, saying, Your father, before his death, gave us orders, saying,\\n17 You are to say to Joseph, Let the wrongdoing of your brothers be overlooked, and the evil they did to you: now, if it is your pleasure, let the sin of the servants of your father's God have forgiveness. And at these words, Joseph was overcome with weeping.\\n18 Then his brothers went, and falling at his feet, said, Truly, we are your servants.\\n19 And Joseph said, Have no fear: am I in the place of God?\\n20 As for you, it was in your mind to do me evil, but God has given a happy outcome, the salvation of numbers of people, as you see today.\\n21 So now, have no fear: for I will take care of you and your little ones. So he gave them comfort with kind words.\\n22 Now Joseph and all his father's family went on living in Egypt: and the years of Joseph's life were a hundred and ten.\\n23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: and the children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, came to birth on Joseph's knees.\\n24 Then Joseph said to his brothers, The time of my death has come; but God will keep you in mind and take you out of this land into the land which he gave by his oath to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.\\n25 Then Joseph made the children of Israel take an oath, saying, God will certainly give effect to his word, and you are to take my bones away from here.\\n26 So Joseph came to his death, being a hundred and ten years old: and they made his body ready, and he was put in a chest in Egypt.\\n

       "3     1 Then Joseph, unable to keep back his feelings before those who were with him, gave orders for everyone to be sent away, and no one was present when he made clear to his brothers who he was.\\n2 And so loud was his weeping, that it came to the ears of the Egyptians and all Pharaoh's house.\\n3 And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph: is my father still living? But his brothers were not able to give him an answer for they were troubled before him.\\n4 Then Joseph said to his brothers, Come near to me. And they came near, And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom you sent into Egypt.\\n5 Now do not be troubled or angry with yourselves for sending me away, because God sent me before you to be the saviour of your lives.\\n6 For these two years have been years of need, and there are still five more years to come in which there will be no ploughing or cutting of grain.\\n7 God sent me before you to keep you and yours living on earth so that you might become a great nation.\\n8 So now it was not you who sent me here, but God: and he has made me as a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.\\n9 Now go quickly to my father, and say to him, Your son Joseph says, God has made me ruler over all the land of Egypt: come down to me straight away:\\n10 The land of Goshen will be your living-place, and you will be near me; you and your children and your children's children, and your flocks and herds and all you have:\\n11 And there I will take care of you, so that you and your family may not be in need, for there are still five bad years to come.\\n12 Now truly, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth which says these things to you.\\n13 Give my father word of all my glory in Egypt and of all you have seen; and come back quickly with my father.\\n14 Then, weeping, he took Benjamin in his arms, and Benjamin himself was weeping on Joseph's neck.\\n15 Then he gave a kiss to all his brothers, weeping over them; and after that his brothers had no fear of talking to him.\\n16 And news of these things went through Pharaoh's house, and it was said that Joseph's brothers were come; and it seemed good to Pharaoh and his servants.\\n17 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to your brothers, Put your goods on your beasts and go back to the land of Canaan;\\n18 And get your father and your families and come back to me: and I will give you all the good things of Egypt, and the fat of the land will be your food.\\n19 And say to them, This you are to do: take carts from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and get your father and come back.\\n20 And take no thought for your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.\\n21 And the children of Israel did as he said; and Joseph gave them carts as had been ordered by Pharaoh, and food for their journey.\\n22 To every one of them he gave three changes of clothing; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred bits of silver and five changes of clothing.\\n23 And to his father he sent ten asses with good things from Egypt on their backs, and ten she-asses with grain and bread and food for his father on the journey.\\n24 And he sent his brothers on their way, and said to them, See that you have no argument on the road.\\n25 So they went up from Egypt and came to the land of Canaan, to their father Jacob.\\n26 And they said to him, Joseph is living, and is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And at this word Jacob was quite overcome, for he had no faith in it.\\n27 And they gave him an account of everything Joseph had said to them; and when he saw the carts which Joseph had sent for them, his spirit came back to him:\\n28 And Israel said, It is enough: Joseph my son is still living; I will go and see him before my death.\\n

       "4     1 Now after two years had gone by, Pharaoh had a dream; and in his dream he was by the side of the Nile;\\n2 And out of the Nile came seven cows, good-looking and fat, and their food was the river-grass.\\n3 And after them seven other cows came out of the Nile, poor-looking and thin; and they were by the side of the other cows.\\n4 And the seven thin cows made a meal of the seven fat cows. Then Pharaoh came out of his sleep.\\n5 But he went to sleep again and had a second dream, in which he saw seven heads of grain, full and good, all on one stem.\\n6 And after them came up seven other heads, thin and wasted by the east wind.\\n7 And the seven thin heads made a meal of the good heads. And when Pharaoh was awake he saw it was a dream.\\n8 And in the morning his spirit was troubled; and he sent for all the wise men of Egypt and all the holy men, and put his dream before them, but no one was able to give him the sense of it.\\n9 Then the chief wine-servant said to Pharaoh, The memory of my sin comes back to me now;\\n10 Pharaoh had been angry with his servants, and had put me in prison in the house of the captain of the army, together with the chief bread-maker;\\n11 And we had a dream on the same night, the two of us, and the dreams had a special sense.\\n12 And there was with us a young Hebrew, the captain's servant, and when we put our dreams before him, he gave us the sense of them.\\n13 And it came about as he said: I was put back in my place, and the bread-maker was put to death by hanging.\\n14 Then Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and they took him quickly out of prison; and when his hair had been cut and his dress changed, he came before Pharaoh.\\n15 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have had a dream, and no one is able to give me the sense of it; now it has come to my ears that you are able to give the sense of a dream when it is put before you.\\n16 Then Joseph said, Without God there will be no answer of peace for Pharaoh.\\n17 Then Pharaoh said, In my dream I was by the side of the Nile:\\n18 And out of the Nile came seven cows, fat and good-looking, and their food was the river-grass;\\n19 Then after them came seven other cows, very thin and poor-looking, worse than any I ever saw in the land of Egypt;\\n20 And the thin cows made a meal of the seven fat cows who came up first;\\n21 And even with the fat cows inside them they seemed as bad as before. And so I came out of my sleep.\\n22 And again in a dream I saw seven heads of grain, full and good, coming up on one stem:\\n23 And then I saw seven other heads, dry, thin, and wasted by the east wind, coming up after them:\\n24 And the seven thin heads made a meal of the seven good heads; and I put this dream before the wise men, but not one of them was able to give me the sense of it.\\n25 Then Joseph said, These two dreams have the same sense: God has made clear to Pharaoh what he is about to do.\\n26 The seven fat cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years: the two have the same sense.\\n27 The seven thin and poor-looking cows who came up after them are seven years; and the seven heads of grain, dry and wasted by the east wind, are seven years when there will be no food.\\n28 As I said to Pharaoh before, God has made clear to him what he is about to do.\\n29 Seven years are coming in which there will be great wealth of grain in Egypt;\\n30 And after that will come seven years when there will not be enough food; and the memory of the good years will go from men's minds; and the land will be made waste by the bad years;\\n31 And men will have no memory of the good time because of the need which will come after, for it will be very bitter.\\n32 And this dream came to Pharaoh twice, because this thing is certain, and God will quickly make it come about.\\n33 And now let Pharaoh make search for a man of wisdom and good sense, and put him in authority over the land of Egypt.\\n34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him put overseers over the land of Egypt to put in store a fifth part of the produce of the land in the good years.\\n35 And let them get together all the food in those good years and make a store of grain under Pharaoh's control for the use of the towns, and let them keep it.\\n36 And let that food be kept in store for the land till the seven bad years which are to come in Egypt; so that the land may not come to destruction through need of food.\\n37 And this seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants.\\n38 Then Pharaoh said to his servants, Where may we get such a man as this, a man in whom is the spirit of God?\\n39 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Seeing that God has made all this clear to you, there is no other man of such wisdom and good sense as you:\\n40 You, then, are to be over my house, and all my people will be ruled by your word: only as king will I be greater than you.\\n41 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have put you over all the land of Egypt.\\n42 Then Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and he had him clothed with the best linen, and put a chain of gold round his neck;\\n43 And he made him take his seat in the second of his carriages; and they went before him crying, Make way! So he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.\\n44 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh; and without your order no man may do anything in all the land of Egypt.\\n45 And Pharaoh gave Joseph the name of Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera, the priest of On, to be his wife. So Joseph went through all the land of Egypt.\\n46 Now Joseph was thirty years old when he came before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from before the face of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt.\\n47 Now in the seven good years the earth gave fruit in masses.\\n48 And Joseph got together all the food of those seven years, and made a store of food in the towns: the produce of the fields round every town was stored up in the town.\\n49 So he got together a store of grain like the sand of the sea; so great a store that after a time he gave up measuring it, for it might not be measured.\\n50 And before the time of need, Joseph had two sons, to whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera, priest of On, gave birth.\\n51 And to the first he gave the name Manasseh, for he said, God has taken away from me all memory of my hard life and of my father's house.\\n52 And to the second he gave the name Ephraim, for he said, God has given me fruit in the land of my sorrow.\\n53 And so the seven good years in Egypt came to an end.\\n54 Then came the first of the seven years of need as Joseph had said: and in every other land they were short of food; but in the land of Egypt there was bread.\\n55 And when all the land of Egypt was in need of food, the people came crying to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to the people, Go to Joseph, and whatever he says to you, do it.\\n56 And everywhere on the earth they were short of food; then Joseph, opening all his store-houses, gave the people of Egypt grain for money; so great was the need of food in the land of Egypt.\\n57 And all lands sent to Egypt, to Joseph, to get grain, for the need was great over all the earth.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "5     1 Now after these things the chief servant who had the care of the wine, and the chief bread-maker in Pharaoh's house, did something against Pharaoh's orders;\\n2 And Pharaoh was angry with his two servants, with the chief wine-servant and the chief bread-maker;\\n3 And he put them in prison under the care of the captain of the army, in the same prison where Joseph himself was shut up.\\n4 And the captain put them in Joseph's care, and he did what was needed for them; and they were kept in prison for some time.\\n5 And these two had a dream on the same night; the chief wine-servant and the chief bread-maker of the king of Egypt, who were in prison, the two of them had dreams with a special sense.\\n6 And in the morning when Joseph came to them he saw that they were looking sad.\\n7 And he said to the servants of Pharaoh who were in prison with him, Why are you looking so sad?\\n8 Then they said to him, We have had a dream, and no one is able to give us the sense. And Joseph said, Does not the sense of dreams come from God? what was your dream?\\n9 Then the chief wine-servant gave Joseph an account of his dream, and said, In my dream I saw a vine before me;\\n10 And on the vine were three branches; and it seemed as if it put out buds and flowers, and from them came grapes ready for cutting.\\n11 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and crushing them into Pharaoh's cup, gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.\\n12 Then Joseph said, This is the sense of your dream: the three branches are three days;\\n13 After three days Pharaoh will give you honour, and put you back into your place, and you will give him his cup as you did before, when you were his wine-servant.\\n14 But keep me in mind when things go well for you, and be good to me and say a good word for me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison:\\n15 For truly I was taken by force from the land of the Hebrews; and I have done nothing for which I might be put in prison.\\n16 Now when the chief bread-maker saw that the first dream had a good sense, he said to Joseph, I had a dream; and in my dream there were three baskets of white bread on my head;\\n17 And in the top basket were all sorts of cooked meats for Pharaoh; and the birds were taking them out of the baskets on my head.\\n18 Then Joseph said, This is the sense of your dream: the three baskets are three days;\\n19 After three days Pharaoh will take you out of prison, hanging you on a tree, so that your flesh will be food for birds.\\n20 Now the third day was Pharaoh's birthday, and he gave a feast for all his servants; and he gave honour to the chief wine-servant and the chief bread-maker among the others.\\n21 And he put the chief wine-servant back in his old place; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.\\n22 But the chief bread-maker was put to death by hanging, as Joseph had said.\\n23 But the wine-servant did not keep Joseph in mind or give a thought to him.\\n

       "6     1 Now Jacob, hearing that there was grain in Egypt, said to his sons, Why are you looking at one another?\\n2 And he said, I have had news that there is grain in Egypt: go down there and get grain for us, so that life and not death may be ours.\\n3 So Joseph's ten brothers went down to get grain from Egypt.\\n4 But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with them, for fear, as he said, that some evil might come to him.\\n5 And the sons of Israel came with all the others to get grain: for they were very short of food in the land of Canaan.\\n6 Now Joseph was ruler over all the land, and it was he who gave out the grain to all the people of the land; and Joseph's brothers came before him and went down on their faces to the earth.\\n7 And when Joseph saw his brothers, it was clear to him who they were, but he made himself strange to them, and talking roughly to them, said, Where do you come from? And they said, From the land of Canaan, to get food.\\n8 Now though Joseph saw that these were his brothers, they had no idea who he was.\\n9 Then the memory of his dreams about them came back to Joseph, and he said to them, You have come secretly to see how poor the land is.\\n10 And they said to him, Not so, my lord: your servants have come with money to get food.\\n11 We are all one man's sons, we are true men; we have not come with any secret purpose.\\n12 And he said to them, No, but you have come to see how poor the land is.\\n13 Then they said, We your servants are twelve brothers, sons of one man in the land of Canaan; the youngest of us is now with our father, and one is dead.\\n14 And Joseph said, It is as I said; you have come with some secret purpose;\\n15 But in this way will you be put to the test: by the life of Pharaoh, you will not go away from this place till your youngest brother comes here.\\n16 Send one of your number to get your brother, and the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are true; if not, by the life of Pharaoh, your purpose is certainly secret.\\n17 So he put them in prison for three days.\\n18 And on the third day Joseph said to them, Do this, if you would keep your lives: for I am a god-fearing man:\\n19 If you are true men, let one of you be kept in prison, while you go and take grain for the needs of your families;\\n20 And come back to me with your youngest brother, so that your words may be seen to be true, and you will not be put to death. This is what you are to do.\\n21 And they said to one another, Truly, we did wrong to our brother, for we saw his grief of mind, and we did not give ear to his prayers; that is why this trouble has come on us.\\n22 And Reuben said to them, Did I not say to you, Do the child no wrong? but you gave no attention; so now, punishment has come on us for his blood.\\n23 They were not conscious that the sense of their words was clear to Joseph, for he had been talking to them through one who had knowledge of their language.\\n24 And turning away from them, he was overcome with weeping; then he went on talking to them again and took Simeon and put chains on him before their eyes.\\n25 Then Joseph gave orders for their bags to be made full of grain, and for every man's money to be put back into his bag, and for food to be given them for the journey: which was done.\\n26 Then they put the bags of grain on their asses and went away.\\n27 Now at their night's resting-place one of them, opening his bag to give his ass some food, saw his money in the mouth of the bag.\\n28 And he said to his brothers, My money has been given back: it is in my bag; then their hearts became full of fear, and turning to one another they said, What is this which God has done to us?\\n29 So when they came to Jacob their father, in the land of Canaan, they gave him an account of all their experiences, saying,\\n30 The man who is the ruler of the country was rough with us and put us in prison, saying that we had come with a secret evil purpose.\\n31 And we said to him, We are true men, we have no evil designs;\\n32 We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is dead, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan.\\n33 And the ruler of the land said, In this way I may be certain that you are true men; let one of you be kept here with me, while you go and take grain for the needs of your families;\\n34 And come back to me with your youngest brother: then I will be certain that you are true men, and I will give your brother back to you and let you do trade in the land.\\n35 And when they took the grain out of their bags, it was seen that every man's parcel of money was in his bag; and when they and their father saw the money, they were full of fear.\\n36 And Jacob their father said to them, You have taken my children from me: Joseph is gone and Simeon is gone, and now you would take Benjamin away; all these things have come on me.\\n37 And Reuben said, Put my two sons to death if I do not come back to you with him; let him be in my care and I will give him safely back to you.\\n38 And he said, I will not let my son go down with you; for his brother is dead and he is all I have: if evil overtakes him on the journey, then through you will my grey head go down to the underworld in sorrow.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "7     1 Now Rachel, because she had no children, was full of envy of her sister; and she said to Jacob, If you do not give me children I will not go on living.\\n2 But Jacob was angry with Rachel, and said, Am I in the place of God, who has kept your body from having fruit?\\n3 Then she said, Here is my servant Bilhah, go in to her, so that she may have a child on my knees, and I may have a family by her.\\n4 So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her.\\n5 And Bilhah became with child, and gave birth to a son.\\n6 Then Rachel said, God has been my judge, and has given ear to my voice, and has given me a son; so he was named Dan.\\n7 And again Bilhah, Rachel's servant, was with child, and gave birth to a second son.\\n8 And Rachel said, I have had a great fight with my sister, and I have overcome her: and she gave the child the name Naphtali.\\n9 When it was clear to Leah that she would have no more children for a time, she gave Zilpah, her servant, to Jacob as a wife.\\n10 And Zilpah, Leah's servant, gave birth to a son.\\n11 And Leah said, It has gone well for me: and she gave him the name Gad.\\n12 And Zilpah, Leah's servant, gave birth to a second son.\\n13 And Leah said, Happy am I! and all women will give witness to my joy: and she gave him the name Asher.\\n14 Now at the time of the grain-cutting, Reuben saw some love-fruits in the field, and took them to his mother Leah. And Rachel said to her, Let me have some of your son's love-fruits.\\n15 But Leah said to her, Is it a small thing that you have taken my husband from me? and now would you take my son's love-fruits? Then Rachel said, You may have him tonight in exchange for your son's love-fruits.\\n16 In the evening, when Jacob came in from the field, Leah went out to him and said, Tonight you are to come to me, for I have given my son's love-fruits as a price for you. And he went in to her that night.\\n17 And God gave ear to her and she became with child, and gave Jacob a fifth son.\\n18 Then Leah said, God has made payment to me for giving my servant-girl to my husband: so she gave her son the name Issachar.\\n19 And again Leah became with child, and she gave Jacob a sixth son.\\n20 And she said, God has given me a good bride-price; now at last will I have my husband living with me, for I have given him six sons: and she gave him the name Zebulun.\\n21 After that she had a daughter, to whom she gave the name Dinah.\\n22 Then God gave thought to Rachel, and hearing her prayer he made her fertile.\\n23 And she was with child, and gave birth to a son: and she said, God has taken away my shame.\\n24 And she gave him the name Joseph, saying, May the Lord give me another son.\\n25 Now after the birth of Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, Let me go away to my place and my country.\\n26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have been your servant, and let me go: for you have knowledge of all the work I have done for you.\\n27 And Laban said, If you will let me say so, do not go away; for I have seen by the signs that the Lord has been good to me because of you.\\n28 Say then what your payment is to be and I will give it.\\n29 Then Jacob said, You have seen what I have done for you, and how your cattle have done well under my care.\\n30 For before I came you had little, and it has been greatly increased; and the Lord has given you a blessing in everything I have done; but when am I to do something for my family?\\n31 And Laban said, What am I to give you? And Jacob said, Do not give me anything; but I will again take up the care of your flock if you will only do this for me:\\n32 Let me go through all your flock today, taking out from among them all the sheep which are marked or coloured or black, and all the marked or coloured goats: these will be my payment.\\n33 And so you will be able to put my honour to the test in time to come; if you see among my flocks any goats which are not marked or coloured, or any sheep which is not black, you may take me for a thief.\\n34 And Laban said, Let it be as you say.\\n35 So that day he took all the he-goats which were banded or coloured, and all the she-goats which were marked or coloured or had white marks, and all the black sheep, and gave them into the care of his sons;\\n36 And sent them three days' journey away: and Jacob took care of the rest of Laban's flock.\\n37 Then Jacob took young branches of trees, cutting off the skin so that the white wood was seen in bands.\\n38 And he put the banded sticks in the drinking-places where the flock came to get water; and they became with young when they came to the water.\\n39 And because of this, the flock gave birth to young which were marked with bands of colour.\\n40 These lambs Jacob kept separate; and he put his flock in a place by themselves and not with Laban's flock.\\n41 And whenever the stronger ones of the flock became with young, Jacob put the sticks in front of them in the drinking-places, so that they might become with young when they saw the sticks.\\n42 But when the flocks were feeble, he did not put the sticks before them; so that the feebler flocks were Laban's and the stronger were Jacob's.\\n43 So Jacob's wealth was greatly increased; he had great flocks and women-servants and men-servants and camels and asses.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "8     1 Now Abraham was old and far on in years: and the Lord had given him everything in full measure.\\n2 And Abraham said to his chief servant, the manager of all his property, Come now, put your hand under my leg:\\n3 And take an oath by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not get a wife for my son Isaac from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living;\\n4 But that you will go into my country and to my relations and get a wife there for my son Isaac.\\n5 And the servant said, If by chance the woman will not come with me into this land, am I to take your son back again to the land from which you came?\\n6 And Abraham said, Take care that you do not let my son go back to that land.\\n7 The Lord God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my birth, and made an oath to me, saying, To your seed I will give this land: he will send his angel before you and give you a wife for my son in that land.\\n8 And if the woman will not come with you, then you are free from this oath; only do not take my son back there.\\n9 And the servant put his hand under Abraham's leg, and gave him his oath about this thing.\\n10 And the servant took ten of his master's camels, and all sorts of good things of his master's, and went to Mesopotamia, to the town of Nahor.\\n11 And he made the camels take their rest outside the town by the water-spring in the evening, at the time when the women came to get water.\\n12 And he said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, let me do well in what I have undertaken this day, and give your mercy to my master Abraham.\\n13 See, I am waiting here by the water-spring; and the daughters of the town are coming out to get water:\\n14 Now, may the girl to whom I say, Let down your vessel and give me a drink, and who says in answer, Here is a drink for you and let me give water to your camels: may she be the one marked out by you for your servant Isaac: so may I be certain that you have been good to my master Abraham.\\n15 And even before his words were ended, Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, who was the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, came out with her water-vessel on her arm.\\n16 She was a very beautiful girl, a virgin, who had never been touched by a man: and she went down to the spring to get water in her vessel.\\n17 And the servant came running to her and said, Give me a little water from your vessel.\\n18 And she said, Take a drink, my lord: and quickly letting down her vessel onto her hand, she gave him a drink.\\n19 And having done so, she said, I will get water for your camels till they have had enough.\\n20 And after putting the water from her vessel into the animals' drinking-place, she went quickly back to the spring and got water for all the camels.\\n21 And the man, looking at her, said nothing, waiting to see if the Lord had given his journey a good outcome.\\n22 And when the camels had had enough, the man took a gold nose-ring, half a shekel in weight, and two ornaments for her arms of ten shekels weight of gold;\\n23 And said to her, Whose daughter are you? is there room in your father's house for us?\\n24 And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, Nahor's wife.\\n25 And she said, We have a great store of dry grass and cattle-food, and there is room for you.\\n26 And with bent head the man gave worship to the Lord;\\n27 And said, Praise be to the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who has given a sign that he is good and true to my master, by guiding me straight to the house of my master's family.\\n28 So the girl went running and took the news of these things to her mother's house\\n29 Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he came out quickly to the man at the water-spring.\\n30 And when he saw the nose-ring and the ornaments on his sister's hands, and when she gave him word of what the man had said to her, then he went out to the man who was waiting with the camels by the water-spring.\\n31 And he said to him, Come in, you on whom is the blessing of the Lord; why are you waiting outside? for I have made the house ready for you, and a place for the camels.\\n32 Then the man came into the house, and Laban took their cords off the camels and gave them dry grass and food, and he gave to him and the men who were with him water for washing their feet.\\n33 And meat was put before him, but he said, I will not take food till I have made my business clear to you. And they said, Do so.\\n34 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.\\n35 The Lord has given my master every blessing, and he has become great: he has given him flocks and herds and silver and gold, and men-servants and women-servants and camels and asses.\\n36 And when Sarah, my master's wife, was old, she gave birth to a son, to whom he has given all he has.\\n37 And my master made me take an oath, saying, Do not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living;\\n38 But go to my father's house and to my relations for a wife for my son.\\n39 And I said to my master, What if the woman will not come with me?\\n40 And he said, The Lord, whom I have ever kept before me, will send his angel with you, who will make it possible for you to get a wife for my son from my relations and my father's house;\\n41 And you will be free from your oath to me when you come to my people; and if they will not give her to you, you will be free from your oath.\\n42 And I came today to the water-spring, and I said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, if it is your purpose to give a good outcome to my journey,\\n43 Let it come about that, while I am waiting here by the water-spring, if a girl comes to get water and I say to her, Give me a little water from your vessel, and she says,\\n44 Take a drink, and I will get water for your camels; let her be the woman marked out by the Lord for my master's son.\\n45 And even while I was saying this to myself, Rebekah came out with her vessel on her arm; and she went down to the spring to get water; and I said to her, Give me a drink.\\n46 And straight away she took down her vessel from her arm, and said, Take a drink, and I will get water for your camels.\\n47 And questioning her, I said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, the son of Nahor, and Milcah his wife. Then I put the ring on her nose and the ornaments on her hands.\\n48 And with bent head I gave worship and praise to the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, by whom I had been guided in the right way, to get the daughter of my master's brother for his son.\\n49 And now, say if you will do what is good and right for my master or not, in order that it may be clear to me what I have to do.\\n50 Then Laban and Bethuel said in answer, This is the Lord's doing: it is not for us to say Yes or No to you.\\n51 See, here is Rebekah: take her and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as the Lord has said.\\n52 And at these words, Abraham's servant went down on his face and gave praise to the Lord.\\n53 Then he took jewels of silver and jewels of gold and fair robes and gave them to Rebekah: and he gave things of value to her mother and her brother.\\n54 Then he and the men who were with him had food and drink, and took their rest there that night; and in the morning he got up, and said, Let me now go back to my master.\\n55 But her brother and her mother said, Let the girl be with us a week or ten days, and then she may go.\\n56 And he said, Do not keep me; the Lord has given a good outcome to my journey; let me now go back to my master.\\n57 And they said, We will send for the girl, and let her make the decision.\\n58 And they sent for Rebekah and said to her, Are you ready to go with this man? And she said, I am ready.\\n59 So they sent their sister Rebekah and her servant with Abraham's servant and his men.\\n60 And they gave Rebekah their blessing, saying, O sister, may you be the mother of thousands and ten thousands; and may your seed overcome all those who make war against them.\\n61 So Rebekah and her servant-women went with the man, seated on the camels; and so the servant took Rebekah and went on his way.\\n62 Now Isaac had come through the waste land to Beer-lahai-roi; for he was living in the South.\\n63 And when the evening was near, he went wandering out into the fields, and lifting up his eyes he saw camels coming.\\n64 And when Rebekah, looking up, saw Isaac, she got down from her camel,\\n65 And said to the servant, Who is that man coming to us through the field? And the servant said, It is my master: then she took her veil, covering her face with it.\\n66 Then the servant gave Isaac the story of all he had done.\\n67 And Isaac took Rebekah into his tent and she became his wife; and in his love for her, Isaac was comforted after his father's death.\\n   \n",
       "9     1 Now the Lord came to him by the holy tree of Mamre, when he was seated in the doorway of his tent in the middle of the day;\\n2 And lifting up his eyes, he saw three men before him; and seeing them, he went quickly to them from the door of the tent, and went down on his face to the earth;\\n3 And said, My Lord, if now I have grace in your eyes, do not go away from your servant:\\n4 Let me get water for washing your feet, and take your rest under the tree:\\n5 And let me get a bit of bread to keep up your strength, and after that you may go on your way: for this is why you have come to your servant. And they said, Let it be so.\\n6 Then Abraham went quickly into the tent, and said to Sarah, Get three measures of meal straight away and make cakes.\\n7 And running to the herd, he took a young ox, soft and fat, and gave it to the servant and he quickly made it ready;\\n8 And he took butter and milk and the young ox which he had made ready and put it before them, waiting by them under the tree while they took food.\\n9 And they said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? And he said, She is in the tent.\\n10 And he said, I will certainly come back to you in the spring, and Sarah your wife will have a son. And his words came to the ears of Sarah who was at the back of the tent-door.\\n11 Now Abraham and Sarah were very old, and Sarah was past the time for giving birth.\\n12 And Sarah, laughing to herself, said, Now that I am used up am I still to have pleasure, my husband himself being old?\\n13 And the Lord said, Why was Sarah laughing and saying, Is it possible for me, being old, to give birth to a child?\\n14 Is there any wonder which the Lord is not able to do? At the time I said, in the spring, I will come back to you, and Sarah will have a child.\\n15 Then Sarah said, I was not laughing; for she was full of fear. And he said, No, but you were laughing.\\n16 And the men went on from there in the direction of Sodom; and Abraham went with them on their way.\\n17 And the Lord said, Am I to keep back from Abraham the knowledge of what I do;\\n18 Seeing that Abraham will certainly become a great and strong nation, and his name will be used by all the nations of the earth as a blessing?\\n19 For I have made him mine so that he may give orders to his children and those of his line after him, to keep the ways of the Lord, to do what is good and right: so that the Lord may do to Abraham as he has said.\\n20 And the Lord said, Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is very great, and their sin is very evil,\\n21 I will go down now, and see if their acts are as bad as they seem from the outcry which has come to me; and if they are not, I will see.\\n22 And the men, turning from that place, went on to Sodom: but Abraham was still waiting before the Lord.\\n23 And Abraham came near, and said, Will you let destruction come on the upright with the sinners?\\n24 If by chance there are fifty upright men in the town, will you give the place to destruction and not have mercy on it because of the fifty upright men?\\n25 Let such a thing be far from you, to put the upright to death with the sinner: will not the judge of all the earth do right?\\n26 And the Lord said, If there are fifty upright men in the town, I will have mercy on it because of them.\\n27 And Abraham answering said, Truly, I who am only dust, have undertaken to put my thoughts before the Lord:\\n28 If by chance there are five less than fifty upright men, will you give up all the town to destruction because of these five? And he said, I will not give it to destruction if there are forty-five.\\n29 And again he said to him, By chance there may be forty there. And he said, I will not do it if there are forty.\\n30 And he said, Let not the Lord be angry with me if I say, What if there are thirty there? And he said, I will not do it if there are thirty.\\n31 And he said, See now, I have undertaken to put my thoughts before the Lord: what if there are twenty there? And he said, I will have mercy because of the twenty.\\n32 And he said, O let not the Lord be angry and I will say only one word more: by chance there may be ten there. And he said, I will have mercy because of the ten.\\n33 And the Lord went on his way when his talk with Abraham was ended, and Abraham went back to his place.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "10    1 And at nightfall the two angels came to Sodom; and Lot was seated at the way into the town: and when he saw them he got up and came before them, falling down on his face to the earth.\\n2 And he said, My masters, come now into your servant's house and take your rest there for the night, and let your feet be washed; and early in the morning you may go on your way. And they said, Not so, but we will take our night's rest in the street.\\n3 But he made his request more strongly, so they went with him into his house; and he got food ready for them, and made unleavened bread, of which they took.\\n4 But before they had gone to bed, the men of the town, all the men of Sodom, came round the house, young and old, from every part of the town;\\n5 And crying out to Lot, they said, Where are the men who came to your house this night? Send them out to us, so that we may take our pleasure with them.\\n6 And Lot went out to them in the doorway, shutting the door after him.\\n7 And he said, My brothers, do not this evil.\\n8 See now, I have two unmarried daughters; I will send them out to you so that you may do to them whatever seems good to you: only do nothing to these men, for this is why they have come under the shade of my roof.\\n9 And they said, Give way there. This one man, they said, came here from a strange country, and will he now be our judge? now we will do worse to you than to them; and pushing violently against Lot, they came near to get the door broken in.\\n10 But the men put out their hands and took Lot into the house to them, shutting the door again.\\n11 But the men who were outside the door they made blind, all of them, small and great, so that they were tired out with looking for the door.\\n12 Then the men said to Lot, Are there any others of your family here? sons-in-law or sons or daughters, take them all out of this place;\\n13 For we are about to send destruction on this place, because a great outcry against them has come to the ears of the Lord; and the Lord has sent us to put an end to the town.\\n14 And Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were married to his daughters, Come, let us go out of this place, for the Lord is about to send destruction on the town. But his sons-in-law did not take him seriously.\\n15 And when morning came, the angels did all in their power to make Lot go, saying, Get up quickly and take your wife and your two daughters who are here, and go, for fear that you come to destruction in the punishment of the town.\\n16 But while he was waiting, the men took him and his wife and his daughters by the hand, for the Lord had mercy on them, and put them outside the town.\\n17 And when they had put them out, he said, Go for your life, without looking back or waiting in the lowland; go quickly to the mountain or you will come to destruction.\\n18 And Lot said to them, Not so, O my Lord;\\n19 See now, your servant has had grace in your eyes and great is your mercy in keeping my life from destruction, but I am not able to get as far as the mountain before evil overtakes me and death;\\n20 This town, now, is near, and it is a little one: O, let me go there (is it not a little one?) so that my life may be safe.\\n21 And he said, See, I have given you your request in this one thing more: I will not send destruction on this town.\\n22 Go there quickly, for I am not able to do anything till you have come there. For this reason, the town was named Zoar.\\n23 The sun was up when Lot came to Zoar.\\n24 Then the Lord sent fire and flaming smoke raining down from heaven on Sodom and Gomorrah.\\n25 And he sent destruction on those towns, with all the lowland and all the people of those towns and every green thing in the land.\\n26 But Lot's wife, looking back, became a pillar of salt.\\n27 And Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had been talking with the Lord:\\n28 And looking in the direction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the lowland, he saw the smoke of the land going up like the smoke of an oven.\\n29 So it came about that when God sent destruction on the towns of the lowland, he kept his word to Abraham, and sent Lot safely away when he put an end to the towns where he was living.\\n30 Then Lot went up out of Zoar to the mountain, and was living there with his two daughters, for fear kept him from living in Zoar: and he and his daughters made their living-place in a hole in the rock.\\n31 And the older daughter said to her sister, Our father is old, and there is no man to be a husband to us in the natural way:\\n32 Come, let us give our father much wine, and we will go into his bed, so that we may have offspring by our father,\\n33 And that night they made their father take much wine; and the older daughter went into his bed; and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away.\\n34 And on the day after, the older daughter said to the younger, Last night I was with my father; let us make him take much wine this night again, and do you go to him, so that we may have offspring by our father.\\n35 And that night again they made their father take much wine; and the younger daughter went into his bed; and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away.\\n36 And so the two daughters of Lot were with child by their father.\\n37 And the older daughter had a son, and she gave him the name Moab: he is the father of the Moabites to this day.\\n38 And the younger had a son and gave him the name Ben-ammi: from him come the children of Ammon to this day.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "11    1 And God kept Noah in mind, and all the living things and the cattle which were with him in the ark: and God sent a wind over the earth, and the waters went down.\\n2 And the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were shut, and the rain from heaven was stopped.\\n3 And the waters went slowly back from the earth, and at the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters were lower.\\n4 And on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.\\n5 And still the waters went on falling, till on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains were seen.\\n6 Then, after forty days, through the open window of the ark which he had made,\\n7 Noah sent out a raven, which went this way and that till the waters were gone from the earth.\\n8 And he sent out a dove, to see if the waters had gone from the face of the earth;\\n9 But the dove saw no resting-place for her foot, and came back to the ark, for the waters were still over all the earth; and he put out his hand, and took her into the ark.\\n10 And after waiting another seven days, he sent the dove out again;\\n11 And the dove came back at evening, and in her mouth was an olive-leaf broken off: so Noah was certain that the waters had gone down on the earth.\\n12 And after seven days more, he sent the dove out again, but she did not come back to him.\\n13 And in the six hundred and first year, on the first day of the first month, the waters were dry on the earth: and Noah took the cover off the ark and saw that the face of the earth was dry.\\n14 And on the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was dry.\\n15 And God said to Noah,\\n16 Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons' wives.\\n17 Take out with you every living thing which is with you, birds and cattle and everything which goes on the earth, so that they may have offspring and be fertile and be increased on the earth.\\n18 And Noah went out with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives;\\n19 And every beast and bird and every living thing of every sort which goes on the earth, went out of the ark.\\n20 And Noah made an altar to the Lord, and from every clean beast and bird he made burned offerings on the altar.\\n21 And when the sweet smell came up to the Lord, he said in his heart, I will not again put a curse on the earth because of man, for the thoughts of man's heart are evil from his earliest days; never again will I send destruction on all living things as I have done.\\n22 While the earth goes on, seed time and the getting in of the

       "12    1 And Abraham took another wife named Keturah.\\n2 She became the mother of Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah.\\n3 And Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan. And from Dedan came the Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim.\\n4 And from Midian came Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah. All these were the offspring of Keturah.\\n5 Now Abraham gave all his property to Isaac;\\n6 But to the sons of his other women he gave offerings, and sent them away, while he was still living, into the east country.\\n7 Now the years of Abraham's life were a hundred and seventy-five.\\n8 And Abraham came to his death, an old man, full of years; and he was put to rest with his people.\\n9 And Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, put him to rest in the hollow rock of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, near Mamre;\\n10 The same field which Abraham got from the children of Heth: there Abraham was put to rest with Sarah, his wife.\\n11 Now after the death of Abraham, the blessing of God was with Isaac, his son.\\n12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, the son of Abraham, whose mother was Hagar the Egyptian, the servant of Sarah:\\n13 These are the names of the sons of Ishmael by their generations: Ishmael's first son was Nebaioth; then Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam\\n14 And Mishma and Dumah and Massa,\\n15 Hadad and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:\\n16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names in their towns and their tent-circles; twelve chiefs with their peoples.\\n17 And the years of Ishmael's life were a hundred and thirty-seven: and he came to his end, and was put to rest with his people.\\n18 And their country was from Havilah to Shur which is east of Egypt: they took their place to the east of all their brothers.\\n19 Now these are the generations of Abraham's son Isaac:\\n20 Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramaean of Paddan-aram, and the sister of Laban the Aramaean, to be his wife.\\n21 Isaac made prayer to the Lord for his wife because she had no children; and the Lord gave ear to his prayer, and Rebekah became with child.\\n22 And the children were fighting together inside her, and she said, If it is to be so, why am I like this? So she went to put her question to the Lord.\\n23 And the Lord said to her, Two nations are in your body, and two peoples will come to birth from you: the one will be stronger than the other, and the older will be the servant of the younger.\\n24 And when the time came for her to give birth, there were two children in her body.\\n25 And the first came out red from head to foot like a robe of hair, and they gave him the name of Esau.\\n26 And after him, his brother came out, gripping Esau's foot; and he was named Jacob: Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them.\\n27 And the boys came to full growth; and Esau became a man of the open country, an expert bowman; but Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.\\n28 Now Isaac's love was for Esau, because Esau's meat was greatly to his taste: but Rebekah had more love for Jacob.\\n29 And one day Jacob was cooking some soup when Esau came in from the fields in great need of food;\\n30 And Esau said to Jacob, Give me a full meal of that red soup, for I am overcome with need for food: for this reason he was named Edom.\\n31 And Jacob said, First of all give me your birthright.\\n32 And Esau said, Truly, I am at the point of death: what profit is the birthright to me?\\n33 And Jacob said, First of all give me your oath; and he gave him his oath, handing over his birthright to Jacob.\\n34 Then Jacob gave him bread and soup; and he took food and drink and went away, caring little for his birthright.\\n

       "13    1 Now when Isaac was old and his eyes had become clouded so that he was not able to see, he sent for Esau, his first son, and said to him, My son: and he said, Here am I.\\n2 And he said, See now, I am old, and my death may take place at any time:\\n3 So take your arrows and your bow and go out to the field and get meat for me;\\n4 And make me food, good to the taste, such as is pleasing to me, and put it before me, so that I may have a meal and give you my blessing before death comes to me.\\n5 Now Isaac's words to his son were said in Rebekah's hearing. Then Esau went out to get the meat.\\n6 And Rebekah said to Jacob, her son, Your father said to your brother Esau in my hearing,\\n7 Go and get some roe's meat and make me a good meal, so that I may be full, and give you my blessing before the Lord before my death.\\n8 Now, my son, do what I say.\\n9 Go to the flock and get me two fat young goats; and I will make of them a meal to your father's taste:\\n10 And you will take it to him, so that he may have a good meal and give you his blessing before his death.\\n11 And Jacob said to Rebekah, his mother, But Esau my brother is covered with hair, while I am smooth:\\n12 If by chance my father puts his hand on me, it will seem to him that I am tricking him, and he will put a curse on me in place of a blessing.\\n13 And his mother said, Let the curse be on me, my son: only do as I say, and go and get them for me.\\n14 So he went and got them and took them to his mother: and she made a meal to his father's taste.\\n15 And Rebekah took the fair robes of her oldest son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son:\\n16 And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck:\\n17 And she gave into the hand of Jacob, her son, the meat and the bread which she had made ready.\\n18 And he came to his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I: who are you, my son?\\n19 And Jacob said, I am Esau, your oldest son; I have done as you said: come now, be seated and take of my meat, so that you may give me a blessing.\\n20 And Isaac said, How is it that you have got it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the Lord your God made it come my way.\\n21 And Isaac said, Come near so that I may put my hand on you, my son, and see if you are truly my son Esau or not.\\n22 And Jacob went near his father Isaac: and he put his hands on him; and he said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.\\n23 And he did not make out who he was, because his hands were covered with hair like his brother Esau's hands: so he gave him a blessing.\\n24 And he said, Are you truly my son Esau? And he said, I am.\\n25 And he said, Put it before me and I will take of my son's meat, so that I may give you a blessing. And he put it before him and he took it; and he gave him wine, and he had a drink.\\n26 And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, my son, and give me a kiss.\\n27 And he came near and gave him a kiss; and smelling the smell of his clothing, he gave him a blessing, and said, See, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field on which the blessing of the Lord has come:\\n28 May God give you the dew of heaven, and the good things of the earth, and grain and wine in full measure:\\n29 Let peoples be your servants, and nations go down before you: be lord over your brothers, and let your mother's sons go down before you: a curse be on everyone by whom you are cursed, and a blessing on those who give you a blessing.\\n30 And when Isaac had come to the end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had not long gone away from Isaac his father, Esau came in from the field.\\n31 And he made ready a meal, good to the taste, and took it to his father, and said to him, Let my father get up and take of his son's meat, so that you may give me a blessing.\\n32 And Isaac his father said to him, Who are you? And he said, I am your oldest son, Esau.\\n33 And in great fear Isaac said, Who then is he who got meat and put it before me, and I took it all before you came, and gave him a blessing, and his it will be?\\n34 And hearing the words of his father, Esau gave a great and bitter cry, and said to his father, Give a blessing to me, even to me, O my father!\\n35 And he said, Your brother came with deceit, and took away your blessing.\\n36 And he said, Is it because he is named Jacob that he has twice taken my place? for he took away my birthright, and now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you not kept a blessing for me?\\n37 And Isaac answering said, But I have made him your master, and have given him all his brothers for servants; I have made him strong with grain and wine: what then am I to do for you, my son?\\n38 And Esau said to his father, Is that the only blessing you have, my father? give a blessing to me, even me! And Esau was overcome with weeping.\\n39 Then Isaac his father made answer and said to him, Far from the fertile places of the earth, and far from the dew of heaven on high will your living-place be:\\n40 By your sword will you get your living and you will be your brother's servant; but when your power is increased his yoke will be broken from off your neck.\\n41 So Esau was full of hate for Jacob because of his father's blessing; and he said in his heart, The days of weeping for my father are near; then I will put my brother Jacob to death.\\n42 Then Rebekah, hearing what Esau had said, sent for Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, It seems that your brother Esau is purposing to put you to death.\\n43 So now, my son, do what I say: go quickly to Haran, to my brother Laban;\\n44 And be there with him for a little time, till your brother's wrath is turned away;\\n45 Till the memory of what you have done to him is past and he is no longer angry: then I will send word for you to come back; are the two of you to be taken from me in one day?\\n46 Then Rebekah said to Isaac, My life is a weariness to me because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob takes a wife from among the daughters of Heth, such as these, the women of this land, of what use will my life be to me?\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "14    1 Then Jacob, lifting up his eyes, saw Esau coming with his four hundred men. So he made a division of the children between Leah and Rachel and the two women-servants.\\n2 He put the servants and their children in front, Leah and her children after them, and Rachel and Joseph at the back.\\n3 And he himself, going before them, went down on his face to the earth seven times till he came near his brother.\\n4 Then Esau came running up to him, and folding him in his arms, gave him a kiss: and the two of them were overcome with weeping.\\n5 Then Esau, lifting up his eyes, saw the women and the children, and said, Who are these with you? And he said, The children whom God in his mercy has given to your servant.\\n6 Then the servants and their children came near, and went down on their faces.\\n7 And Leah came near with her children, and then Joseph and Rachel, and they did the same.\\n8 And he said, What were all those herds which I saw on the way? And Jacob said, They were an offering so that I might have grace in my lord's eyes.\\n9 But Esau said, I have enough; keep what is yours, my brother, for yourself.\\n10 And Jacob said, Not so; but if I have grace in your eyes, take them as a sign of my love, for I have seen your face as one may see the face of God, and you have been pleased with me.\\n11 Take my offering then, with my blessing; for God has been very good to me and I have enough: so at his strong request, he took it.\\n12 And he said, Let us go on our journey together, and I will go in front.\\n13 But Jacob said, My lord may see that the children are only small, and there are young ones in my flocks and herds: one day's over-driving will be the destruction of all the flock.\\n14 Do you, my lord, go on before your servant; I will come on slowly, at the rate at which the cattle and the children are able to go, till I come to my lord at Seir.\\n15 And Esau said, Then keep some of my men with you. And he said, What need is there for that, if my lord is pleased with me?\\n16 So Esau, turning back that day, went on his way to Seir.\\n17 And Jacob went on to Succoth, where he made a house for himself and put up tents for his cattle: for this reason the place was named Succoth.\\n18 So Jacob came safely from Paddan-aram to the town of Shechem in the land of Canaan, and put up his tents near the town.\\n19 And for a hundred bits of money he got from the children of Hamor, the builder of Shechem, the field in which he had put up his tents.\\n20 And there he put up an altar, naming it El,

       "15    1 And on his way Jacob came face to face with the angels of God.\\n2 And when he saw them he said, This is the army of God: so he gave that place the name of Mahanaim.\\n3 Now Jacob sent servants before him to Esau, his brother, in the land of Seir, the country of Edom;\\n4 And he gave them orders to say these words to Esau: Your servant Jacob says, Till now I have been living with Laban:\\n5 And I have oxen and asses and flocks and men-servants and women-servants: and I have sent to give my lord news of these things so that I may have grace in his eyes.\\n6 When the servants came back they said, We have seen your brother Esau and he is coming out to you, and four hundred men with him.\\n7 Then Jacob was in great fear and trouble of mind: and he put all the people and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two groups;\\n8 And said, If Esau, meeting one group, makes an attack on them, the others will get away safely.\\n9 Then Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, the God of my father Isaac, the Lord who said to me, Go back to your country and your family and I will be good to you:\\n10 I am less than nothing in comparison with all your mercies and your faith to me your servant; for with only my stick in my hand I went across Jordan, and now I have become two armies.\\n11 Be my saviour from the hand of Esau, my brother: for my fear is that he will make an attack on me, putting to death mother and child.\\n12 And you said, Truly, I will be good to you, and make your seed like the sand of the sea which may not be numbered.\\n13 Then he put up his tent there for the night; and from among his goods he took, as an offering for his brother Esau,\\n14 Two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred females and twenty males from the sheep,\\n15 Thirty camels with their young ones, forty cows, ten oxen, twenty asses, and ten young asses.\\n16 These he gave to his servants, every herd by itself, and he said to his servants, Go on before me, and let there be a space between one herd and another.\\n17 And he gave orders to the first, saying, When my brother Esau comes to you and says, Whose servant are you, and where are you going, and whose are these herds?\\n18 Then say to him, These are your servant Jacob's; they are an offering for my lord, for Esau; and he himself is coming after us.\\n19 And he gave the same orders to the second and the third and to all those who were with the herds, saying, This is what you are to say to Esau when you see him;\\n20 And you are to say further, Jacob, your servant, is coming after us. For he said to himself, I will take away his wrath by the offering which I have sent on, and then I will come before him: it may be that I will have grace in his eyes.\\n21 So the servants with the offerings went on in front, and he himself took his rest that night in the tents with his people.\\n22 And in the night he got up, and taking with him his two wives and the two servant-women and his eleven children, he went over the river Jabbok.\\n23 He took them and sent them over the stream with all he had.\\n24 Then Jacob was by himself; and a man was fighting with him till dawn.\\n25 But when the man saw that he was not able to overcome Jacob, he gave him a blow in the hollow part of his leg, so that his leg was damaged.\\n26 And he said to him, Let me go now, for the dawn is near. But Jacob said, I will not let you go till you have given me your blessing.\\n27 Then he said, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.\\n28 And he said, Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel: for in your fight with God and with men you have overcome.\\n29 Then Jacob said, What is your name? And he said, What is my name to you? Then he gave him a blessing.\\n30 And Jacob gave that place the name of Peniel, saying, I have seen God face to face, and still I am living.\\n31 And while he was going past Peniel, the sun came up. And he went with unequal steps because of his damaged leg.\\n32 For this reason the children of Israel, even today, never take that muscle in the hollow of the leg as food, because the hollow of Jacob's leg was touched.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "16    1 Then came a time of great need in the land, like that which had been before in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, at Gerar.\\n2 And the Lord came to him in a vision and said, Do not go down to Egypt; keep in the land of which I will give you knowledge:\\n3 Keep in this land, and I will be with you and give you my blessing; for to you and to your seed will I give all these lands, giving effect to the oath which I made to your father Abraham;\\n4 I will make your seed like the stars of heaven in number, and will give them all these lands, and your seed will be a blessing to all the nations of the earth;\\n5 Because Abraham gave ear to my voice and kept my words, my rules, my orders, and my laws.\\n6 So Isaac went on living in Gerar;\\n7 And when he was questioned by the men of the place about his wife, he said, She is my sister; fearing to say, She is my wife; for, he said, the men of the place may put me to death on account of Rebekah; because she is very beautiful.\\n8 And when he had been there for some time, Abimelech, king of the Philistines, looking through a window, saw Isaac playing with Rebekah his wife.\\n9 And he said to Isaac, It is clear that she is your wife: why then did you say, She is my sister? And Isaac said, For fear that I might be put to death because of her.\\n10 Then Abimelech said, What have you done to us? one of the people might well have had connection with your wife, and the sin would have been ours.\\n11 And Abimelech gave orders to his people that anyone touching Isaac or his wife was to be put to death.\\n12 Now Isaac, planting seed in that land, got in the same year fruit a hundred times as much, for the blessing of the Lord was on him.\\n13 And his wealth became very great, increasing more and more;\\n14 For he had great wealth of flocks and herds and great numbers of servants; so that the Philistines were full of envy.\\n15 Now all the water-holes, which his father's servants had made in the days of Abraham, had been stopped up with earth by the Philistines.\\n16 And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go away from us, for you are stronger than we are.\\n17 So Isaac went away from there, and put up his tents in the valley of Gerar, making his living-place there.\\n18 And he made again the water-holes which had been made in the days of Abraham his father, and which had been stopped up by the Philistines; and he gave them the names which his father had given them.\\n19 Now Isaac's servants made holes in the valley, and came to a spring of flowing water.\\n20 But the herdmen of Gerar had a fight with Isaac's herdmen, for they said, The spring is ours: so he gave the spring the name of Esek, because there was a fight about it.\\n21 Then they made another water-hole, and there was a fight about that, so he gave it the name of Sitnah.\\n22 Then he went away from there, and made another water-hole, about which there was no fighting: so he gave it the name of Rehoboth, for he said, Now the Lord has made room for us, and we will have fruit in this land.\\n23 And from there he went on to Beer-sheba.\\n24 That night the Lord came to him in a vision, and said, I am the God of your father Abraham: have no fear for I am with you, blessing you, and your seed will be increased because of my servant Abraham.\\n25 Then he made an altar there, and gave worship to the name of the Lord, and he put up his tents there, and there his servants made a water-hole.\\n26 And Abimelech had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his friend and Phicol, the captain of his army.\\n27 And Isaac said to them, Why have you come to me, seeing that in your hate for me you sent me away from you?\\n28 And they said, We saw clearly that the Lord was with you: so we said, Let there be an oath between us and you, and let us make an agreement with you;\\n29 That you will do us no damage, even as we put no hand on you, and did you nothing but good, and sent you away in peace: and now the blessing of the Lord is on you.\\n30 Then he made a feast for them, and they all had food and drink.\\n31 And early in the morning they took an oath one to the other: then Isaac sent them away and they went on their way in peace.\\n32 And that day Isaac's servants came to him and gave him word of the water-hole which they had made, and said to him, We have come to water.\\n33 And he gave it the name of Shibah: so the name of that town is Beer-sheba to this day.\\n34 And when Esau was forty years old, he took as his wives Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite:\\n35 And Isaac and Rebekah had grief of mind because of them.\\n

       "17    1 Now after these things, God put Abraham to the test, and said to him, Abraham; and he said, Here am I.\\n2 And he said to him, Take your son, your dearly loved only son Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah and give him as a burned offering on one of the mountains of which I will give you knowledge.\\n3 And Abraham got up early in the morning, and made ready his ass, and took with him two of his young men and Isaac, his son, and after the wood for the burned offering had been cut, he went on his way to the place of which God had given him word.\\n4 And on the third day, Abraham, lifting up his eyes, saw the place a long way off.\\n5 Then he said to his young men, Keep here with the ass; and I and the boy will go on and give worship and come back again to you.\\n6 And Abraham put the wood for the burned offering on his son's back, and he himself took the fire and the knife in his hand, and the two of them went on together.\\n7 Then Isaac said to Abraham, My father; and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, We have wood and fire here, but where is the lamb for the burned offering?\\n8 And Abraham said, God himself will give the lamb for the burned offering: so they went on together.\\n9 And they came to the place of which God had given him knowledge; and there Abraham made the altar and put the wood in place on it, and having made tight the bands round Isaac his son, he put him on the wood on the altar.\\n10 And stretching out his hand, Abraham took the knife to put his son to death.\\n11 But the voice of the angel of the Lord came from heaven, saying, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.\\n12 And he said, Let not your hand be stretched out against the boy to do anything to him; for now I am certain that the fear of God is in your heart, because you have not kept back your son, your only son, from me.\\n13 And lifting up his eyes, Abraham saw a sheep fixed by its horns in the brushwood: and Abraham took the sheep and made a burned offering of it in place of his son.\\n14 And Abraham gave that place the name Yahweh-yireh: as it is said to this day, In the mountain the Lord is seen.\\n15 And the voice of the angel of the Lord came to Abraham a second time from heaven,\\n16 Saying, I have taken an oath by my name, says the Lord, because you have done this and have not kept back from me your dearly loved only son,\\n17 That I will certainly give you my blessing, and your seed will be increased like the stars of heaven and the sand by the seaside; your seed will take the land of those who are against them;\\n18 And your seed will be a blessing to all the nations of the earth, because you have done what I gave you orders to do.\\n19 Then Abraham went back to his young men and they went together to Beer-sheba, the place where Abraham was living.\\n20 After these things, Abraham had news that Milcah, the wife of his brother Nahor, had given birth to children;\\n21 Uz the oldest, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel, the father of Aram,\\n22 And Chesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel.\\n23 Bethuel was the father of Rebekah: these eight were the children of Milcah and Nahor, Abraham's brother.\\n24 And his servant Reumah gave

       "19    1 Now Jacob was living in the land where his father had made a place for himself, in the land of Canaan.\\n2 These are the generations of Jacob: Joseph, a boy seventeen years old, was looking after the flock, together with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives; and Joseph gave their father a bad account of them.\\n3 Now the love which Israel had for Joseph was greater than his love for all his other children, because he got him when he was an old man: and he had a long coat made for him.\\n4 And because his brothers saw that Joseph was dearer to his father than all the others, they were full of hate for him, and would not say a kind word to him.\\n5 Now Joseph had a dream, and he gave his brothers an account of it, which made their hate greater than ever.\\n6 And he said to them, Let me give you the story of my dream.\\n7 We were in the field, getting the grain stems together, and my grain kept upright, and yours came round and went down on the earth before mine.\\n8 And his brothers said to him, Are you to be our king? will you have authority over us? And because of his dream and his words, their hate for him became greater than ever.\\n9 Then he had another dream, and gave his brothers an account of it, saying, I have had another dream: the sun and the moon and eleven stars gave honour to me.\\n10 And he gave word of it to his father and his brothers; but his father protesting said, What sort of a dream is this? am I and your mother and your brothers to go down on our faces to the earth before you?\\n11 And his brothers were full of envy; but his father kept his words in mind.\\n12 Now his brothers went to keep watch over their father's flock in Shechem.\\n13 And Israel said to Joseph, Are not your brothers with the flock in Shechem? come, I will send you to them. And he said to him, Here am I.\\n14 And he said to him, Go now, and see if your brothers are well and how the flock is; then come back and give me word. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.\\n15 And a man saw him wandering in the country, and said to him, What are you looking for?\\n16 And he said, I am looking for my brothers; please give me word of where they are keeping their flock.\\n17 And the man said, They have gone away from here, for they said in my hearing, Let us go to Dothan. So Joseph went after them and came up with them at Dothan.\\n18 But they saw him when he was a long way off, and before he came near them they made a secret design against him to put him to death;\\n19 Saying to one another, See, here comes this dreamer.\\n20 Let us now put him to death and put his body into one of these holes, and we will say, An evil beast has put him to death: then we will see what becomes of his dreams.\\n21 But Reuben, hearing these words, got him out of their hands, saying, Let us not take his life.\\n22 Do not put him to a violent death, but let him be placed in one of the holes; this he said to keep him safe from their hands, with the purpose of taking him back to his father again.\\n23 So when Joseph came to his brothers, they took off his long coat which he had on;\\n24 And they took him and put him in the hole: now the hole had no water in it.\\n25 Then seating themselves, they took their meal: and looking up, they saw a travelling band of Ishmaelites, coming from Gilead on their way to Egypt, with spices and perfumes on their camels.\\n26 And Judah said to his brothers, What profit is there in putting our brother to death and covering up his blood?\\n27 Let us give him to these Ishmaelites for a price, and let us not put violent hands on him, for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brothers gave ear to him.\\n28 And some traders from Midian went by; so pulling Joseph up out of the hole, they gave him to the Ishmaelites for twenty bits of silver, and they took him to Egypt.\\n29 Now when Reuben came back to the hole, Joseph was not there; and giving signs of grief,\\n30 He went back to his brothers, and said, The child is gone; what am I to do?\\n31 Then they took Joseph's coat, and put on it some of the blood from a young goat which they had put to death,\\n32 And they took the coat to their father, and said, We came across this; is it your son's coat or not?\\n33 And he saw that it was, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast has put him to death; without doubt Joseph has come to a cruel end.\\n34 Then Jacob, giving signs of grief, put on haircloth, and went on weeping for his son day after day.\\n35 And all his sons and all his daughters came to give him comfort, but he would not be comforted, saying with weeping, I will go down to the underworld to my son. So great was his father's sorrow for him.\\n36 And in Egypt the men of Midian gave him for a price to Potiphar, a captain of high position in Pharaoh's house.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "20    1 Now the years of Sarah's life were a hundred and twenty-seven.\\n2 And Sarah's death took place in Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron, in the land of Canaan: and Abraham went into his house, weeping and sorrowing for Sarah.\\n3 And Abraham came from his dead and said to the children of Heth,\\n4 I am living among you as one from a strange country: give me some land here as my property, so that I may put my dead to rest.\\n5 And in answer the children of Heth said to Abraham,\\n6 My lord, truly you are a great chief among us; take the best of our resting-places for your dead; not one of us will keep back from you a place where you may put your dead to rest.\\n7 And Abraham got up and gave honour to the children of Heth, the people of that land.\\n8 And he said to them, If you will let me put my dead to rest here, make a request for me to Ephron, the son of Zohar,\\n9 That he will give me the hollow in the rock named Machpelah, which is his property at the end of his field; let him give it to me for its full price as a resting-place for my dead among you.\\n10 Now Ephron was seated among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite gave Abraham his answer in the hearing of the children of Heth, and of all those who came into his town, saying,\\n11 No, my lord, I will give you the field with the hollow in the rock; before all the children of my people will I give it to you for a resting-place for your dead.\\n12 And Abraham went down on his face before the people of the land.\\n13 And Abraham said to Ephron, in the hearing of the people of the land, If only you will give ear to me, I will give you the price of the field; take it, and let me put my dead to rest there.\\n14 So Ephron said to Abraham,\\n15 My lord, give ear to me: the value of the land is four hundred shekels; what is that between me and you? so put your dead to rest there.\\n16 And Abraham took note of the price fixed by Ephron in the hearing of the children of Heth, and gave him four hundred shekels in current money.\\n17 So Ephron's field at Machpelah near Mamre, with the hollow in the rock and all the trees in the field and round it,\\n18 Became the property of Abraham before the eyes of the children of Heth and of all who came into the town.\\n19 Then Abraham put Sarah his wife to rest in the hollow rock in the field of Machpelah near Mamre, that is, Hebron in the land of Canaan.\\n20 And the field and the hollow rock were handed over to Abraham as his property by the children of Heth.\\n

       "21    1 And God said to Jacob, Go up now to Beth-el and make your living-place there: and put up an altar there to the God who came to you when you were in flight from your brother Esau.\\n2 Then Jacob said to all his people, Put away the strange gods which are among you, and make yourselves clean, and put on a change of clothing:\\n3 And let us go up to Beth-el: and there I will make an altar to God, who gave me an answer in the day of my trouble, and was with me wherever I went.\\n4 Then they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which they had, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob put them away under the holy tree at Shechem.\\n5 So they went on their journey: and the fear of God was on the towns round about, so that they made no attack on the sons of Jacob.\\n6 And Jacob came to Luz in the land of Canaan (which is the same as Beth-el), he and all his people.\\n7 And there he made an altar, naming the place El-beth-el: because it was there he had the vision of God when he was in flight from his brother.\\n8 And Deborah, the servant who had taken care of Rebekah from her birth, came to her end, and was put to rest near Beth-el, under the holy tree: and they gave it the name of Allon-bacuth.\\n9 Now when Jacob was on his way from Paddan-aram, God came to him again and, blessing him, said,\\n10 Jacob is your name, but it will be so no longer; from now your name will be Israel; so he was named Israel.\\n11 And God said to him, I am God, the Ruler of all: be fertile, and have increase; a nation, truly a group of nations, will come from you, and kings will be your offspring;\\n12 And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you; and to your seed after you I will give the land.\\n13 Then God went up from him in the place where he had been talking with him.\\n14 And Jacob put up a pillar in the place where he had been talking with God, and put a drink offering on it, and oil.\\n15 And he gave to the place where God had been talking with him, the name of Beth-el.\\n16 So they went on from Beth-el; and while they were still some distance from Ephrath, the pains of birth came on Rachel and she had a hard time.\\n17 And when her pain was very great, the woman who was helping her said, Have no fear; for now you will have another son.\\n18 And in the hour when her life went from her (for death came to her), she gave the child the name Ben-oni: but his father gave him the name of Benjamin.\\n19 So Rachel came to her end and was put to rest on the road to Ephrath (which is Beth-lehem).\\n20 And Jacob put up a pillar on her resting-place; which is named, The Pillar of the resting-place of Rachel, to this day.\\n21 And Israel went journeying on and put up his tents on the other side of the tower of the flock.\\n22 Now while they were living in that country, Reuben had connection with Bilhah, his father's servant-woman: and Israel had news of it.\\n23 Now Jacob had twelve sons: the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first son, and Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun;\\n24 The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;\\n25 The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant: Dan and Naphtali;\\n26 The sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant: Gad and Asher; these are the sons whom Jacob had in Paddan-aram.\\n27 And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, at Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac had been living.\\n28 And Isaac was a hundred and eighty years old.\\n29 Then Isaac came to his end and was put to rest with his father's people, an old man after a long life: and Jacob and Esau, his sons, put him in his last resting-place.\\n

       "22    1 And the Lord came to Sarah as he had said and did to her as he had undertaken.\\n2 And Sarah became with child, and gave Abraham a son when he was old, at the time named by God.\\n3 And Abraham gave to his son, to whom Sarah had given birth, the name Isaac.\\n4 And when his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham made him undergo circumcision, as God had said to him.\\n5 Now Abraham was a hundred years old when the birth of Isaac took place.\\n6 And Sarah said, God has given me cause for laughing, and everyone who has news of it will be laughing with me.\\n7 And she said, Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would have a child at her breast? for see, I have given him a son now when he is old.\\n8 And when the child was old enough to be taken from the breast, Abraham made a great feast.\\n9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian playing with Isaac.\\n10 So she said to Abraham, Send away that woman and her son: for the son of that woman is not to have a part in the heritage with my son Isaac.\\n11 And this was a great grief to Abraham because of his son.\\n12 But God said, Let it not be a grief to you because of the boy and Hagar his mother; give ear to whatever Sarah says to you, because it is from Isaac that your seed will take its name.\\n13 And I will make a nation of the son of your servant-woman, because he is your seed.\\n14 And early in the morning Abraham got up, and gave Hagar some bread and a water-skin, and put the boy on her back, and sent her away: and she went, wandering in the waste land of Beer-sheba.\\n15 And when all the water in the skin was used up, she put the child down under a tree.\\n16 And she went some distance away, about an arrow flight, and seating herself on the earth, she gave way to bitter weeping, saying, Let me not see the death of my child.\\n17 And the boy's cry came to the ears of God; and the angel of God said to Hagar from heaven, Hagar, why are you weeping? have no fear, for the child's cry has come to the ears of God.\\n18 Come, take your child in your arms, for I will make of him a great nation.\\n19 Then God made her eyes open, and she saw a water-spring, and she got water in the skin and gave the boy a drink.\\n20 And God was with the boy, and he became tall and strong, and he became a bowman, living in the waste land.\\n21 And while he was in the waste land of Paran, his mother got him a wife from the land of Egypt.\\n22 Now at that time, Abimelech and Phicol, the captain of his army, said to Abraham, I see that God is with you in all you do.\\n23 Now, then, give me your oath, in the name of God, that you will not be false to me or to my sons after me, but that as I have been good to you, so you will be to me and to this land where you have been living.\\n24 And Abraham said, I will give you my oath.\\n25 But Abraham made a protest to Abimelech because of a water-hole which Abimelech's servants had taken by force.\\n26 But Abimelech said, I have no idea who has done this thing; you never gave me word of it, and I had no knowledge of it till this day.\\n27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made an agreement together.\\n28 And Abraham put seven young lambs of the flock on one side by themselves.\\n29 Then Abimelech said, What are these seven lambs which you have put on one side?\\n30 And he said, Take these seven lambs from me as a witness that I have made this water-hole.\\n31 So he gave that place the name Beer-sheba, because there the two of them had given their oaths.\\n32 So they made an agreement at Beer-sheba, and Abimelech and Phicol, the captain of his army, went back to the land of the Philistines.\\n33 And Abraham, after planting a holy tree in Beer-sheba, gave worship to the name of the Lord, the Eternal God.\\n34 And Abraham went on living in the land of the Philistines as in a strange country.\\n

       "23    1 Now it came to the ears of Jacob that Laban's sons were saying, Jacob has taken away all our father's property, and in this way he has got all this wealth.\\n2 And Jacob saw that Laban's feeling for him was no longer what it had been before.\\n3 Then the Lord said to Jacob, Go back to the land of your fathers, and to your relations, and I will be with you.\\n4 And Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to come to him in the field among his flock.\\n5 And he said to them, It is clear to me that your father's feeling is no longer what it was to me; but the God of my father has been with me\\n6 And you have seen how I have done all in my power for your father,\\n7 But your father has not kept faith with me, and ten times he has made changes in my payment; but God has kept him from doing me damage.\\n8 If he said, All those in the flock which have marks are to be yours, then all the flock gave birth to marked young; and if he said, All the banded ones are to be yours, then all the flock had banded young.\\n9 So God has taken away your father's cattle and has given them to me.\\n10 And at the time when the flock were with young, I saw in a dream that all the he-goats which were joined with the she-goats were banded and marked and coloured.\\n11 And in my dream the angel of the Lord said to me, Jacob: and I said, Here am I.\\n12 And he said, See how all the he-goats are banded and marked and coloured: for I have seen what Laban has done to you.\\n13 I am the God of Beth-el, where you put oil on the pillar and took an oath to me: now then, come out of this land and go back to the country of your birth.\\n14 Then Rachel and Leah said to him in answer, What part or heritage is there for us in our father's house?\\n15 Are we not as people from a strange country to him? for he took a price for us and now it is all used up.\\n16 For the wealth which God has taken from him is ours and our children's; so now, whatever God has said to you, do.\\n17 Then Jacob put his wives and his sons on camels;\\n18 And sending on before him all his cattle and his property which he had got together in Paddan-aram, he made ready to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.\\n19 Now Laban had gone to see to the cutting of the wool of his sheep; so Rachel secretly took the images of the gods of her father's house.\\n20 And Jacob went away secretly, without giving news of his flight to Laban the Aramaean.\\n21 So he went away with all he had, and went across the River in the direction of the hill-country of Gilead.\\n22 And on the third day Laban had news of Jacob's flight.\\n23 And taking the men of his family with him, he went after him for seven days and overtook him in the hill-country of Gilead.\\n24 Then God came to Laban in a dream by night, and said to him, Take care that you say nothing good or bad to Jacob.\\n25 Now when Laban overtook him, Jacob had put up his tent in the hill-country; and Laban and his brothers put up their tents in the hill-country of Gilead.\\n26 And Laban said to Jacob, Why did you go away secretly, taking my daughters away like prisoners of war?\\n27 Why did you make a secret of your flight, not giving me word of it, so that I might have sent you away with joy and songs, with melody and music?\\n28 You did not even let me give a kiss to my sons and my daughters. This was a foolish thing to do.\\n29 It is in my power to do you damage: but the God of your father came to me this night, saying, Take care that you say nothing good or bad to Jacob.\\n30 And now, it seems, you are going because your heart's desire is for your father's house; but why have you taken my gods?\\n31 And Jacob, in answer, said to Laban, My fear was that you might take your daughters from me by force.\\n32 As for your gods, if anyone of us has them, let him be put to death: make search before us all for what is yours, and take it. For Jacob had no knowledge that Rachel had taken them.\\n33 So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent, and into the tents of the two servant-women, but they were not there; and he came out of Leah's tent and went into Rachel's.\\n34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and had put them in the camels' basket, and was seated on them. And Laban, searching through all the tent, did not come across them.\\n35 And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry because I do not get up before you, for I am in the common condition of women. And with all his searching, he did not come across the images.\\n36 Then Jacob was angry with Laban, and said, What crime or sin have I done that you have come after me with such passion?\\n37 Now that you have made search through all my goods, what have you seen which is yours? Make it clear now before my people and your people, so that they may be judges between us.\\n38 These twenty years I have been with you; your sheep and your goats have had young without loss, not one of your he-goats have I taken for food.\\n39 Anything which was wounded by beasts I did not take to you, but myself made up for the loss of it; you made me responsible for whatever was taken by thieves, by day or by night.\\n40 This was my condition, wasted by heat in the day and by the bitter cold at night; and sleep went from my eyes.\\n41 These twenty years I have been in your house; I was your servant for fourteen years because of your daughters, and for six years I kept your flock, and ten times was my payment changed.\\n42 If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would have sent me away with nothing in my hands. But God has seen my troubles and the work of my hands, and this night he kept you back.\\n43 Then Laban, answering, said, These women are my daughters and these children my children, the flocks and all you see are mine: what now may I do for my daughters and for their children?\\n44 Come, let us make an agreement, you and I; and let it be for a witness between us.\\n45 Then Jacob took a stone and put it up as a pillar.\\n46 And Jacob said to his people, Get stones together; and they did so; and they had a meal there by the stones.\\n47 And the name Laban gave it was Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob gave it the name of Galeed.\\n48 And Laban said, These stones are a witness between you and me today. For this reason its name was Galeed,\\n49 And Mizpah, for he said, May the Lord keep watch on us when we are unable to see one another's doings.\\n50 If you are cruel to my daughters, or if you take other wives in addition to my daughters, then though no man is there to see, God will be the witness between us.\\n51 And Laban said, See these stones and this pillar which I have put between you and me;\\n52 They will be witness that I will not go over these stones to you, and you will not go over these stones or this pillar to me, for any evil purpose.\\n53 May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, be our judge. Then Jacob took an oath by the Fear of his father Isaac.\\n54 And Jacob made an offering on the mountain, and gave orders to his people to take food: so they had a meal and took their rest that night on the mountain.\\n55 And early in the morning Laban, after kissing and blessing his daughters, went on his way back to his country.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "24    1 And Abraham went on his way from there to the land of the South, and was living between Kadesh and Shur, in Gerar.\\n2 And Abraham said of Sarah, his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent and took Sarah.\\n3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream in the night, and said to him, Truly you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a man's wife.\\n4 Now Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, Lord, will you put to death an upright nation?\\n5 Did he not say to me himself, She is my sister? and she herself said, He is my brother: with an upright heart and clean hands have I done this.\\n6 And God said to him in the dream, I see that you have done this with an upright heart, and I have kept you from sinning against me: for this reason I did not let you come near her.\\n7 So now, give the man back his wife, for he is a prophet, and let him say a prayer for you, so your life may be safe: but if you do not give her back, be certain that death will come to you and all your house.\\n8 So Abimelech got up early in the morning and sent for all his servants and gave them word of these things, and they were full of fear.\\n9 Then Abimelech sent for Abraham, and said, What have you done to us? what wrong have I done you that you have put on me and on my kingdom so great a sin? You have done to me things which are not to be done.\\n10 And Abimelech said to Abraham, Why did you do this thing?\\n11 And Abraham said, Because it seemed to me that there was no fear of God in this place, and that they might put me to death because of my wife.\\n12 And, in fact, she is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife:\\n13 And when God sent me wandering from my father's house, I said to her, Let this be the sign of your love for me; wherever we go, say of me, He is my brother.\\n14 Then Abimelech gave to Abraham sheep and oxen and men-servants and women-servants, and gave him back his wife Sarah.\\n15 And Abimelech said, See, all my land is before you; take whatever place seems good to you.\\n16 And he said to Sarah, See, I have given to your brother a thousand bits of silver so that your wrong may be put right; now your honour is clear in the eyes of all.\\n17 Then Abraham made prayer to God, and God made Abimelech well

       "25    1 And Israel went on his journey with all he had, and came to Beer-sheba, where he made offerings to the God of his father Isaac.\\n2 And God said to Israel in a night-vision, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.\\n3 And he said, I am God, the God of your father: go down to Egypt without fear, for I will make a great nation of you there:\\n4 I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will see that you come back again, and at your death Joseph will put his hands on your eyes.\\n5 Then Jacob went on from Beer-sheba; and the sons of Jacob took their father and their little ones and their wives in the carts which Pharaoh had sent for them.\\n6 And they took their cattle and all the goods which they had got in the land of Canaan, and came to Egypt, even Jacob and all his seed:\\n7 His sons and his sons' sons, his daughters and his daughters' sons and all his family he took with him into Egypt.\\n8 And these are the names of the children of Israel who came into Egypt, even Jacob and all his sons: Reuben, Jacob's oldest son;\\n9 And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch and Pallu and Hezron and Carmi;\\n10 And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul, the son of a woman of Canaan;\\n11 And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari;\\n12 And the sons of Judah: Er and Onan and Shelah and Perez and Zerah: but Er and Onan had come to their death in the land of Canaan; and the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.\\n13 And the sons of Issachar: Tola and Puah and Job and Shimron;\\n14 And the sons of Zebulun: Sered and Elon and Jahleel;\\n15 All these, together with his daughter Dinah, were the children of Leah, whom Jacob had by her in Paddan-aram; they were thirty-three in number.\\n16 And the sons of Gad: Ziphion and Haggi, Shuni and Ezbon, Eri and Arodi and Areli;\\n17 And the sons of Asher: Jimnah and Ishvah and Ishvi and Beriah, and Sarah, their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.\\n18 These are the children of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah, and Jacob had these sixteen children by her.\\n19 The sons of Jacob's wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.\\n20 And Joseph had Manasseh and Ephraim in the land of Egypt, by Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera, priest of On.\\n21 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah and Becher and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, Muppim and Huppim and Ard.\\n22 All these were the children of Rachel whom Jacob had by her, fourteen persons.\\n23 And the son of Dan was Hushim.\\n24 And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel and Guni and Jezer and Shillem.\\n25 These were the children of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel, seven persons.\\n26 All the persons who came with Jacob into Egypt, the offspring of his body, were sixty-six, without taking into account the wives of Jacob's sons.\\n27 And the sons of Joseph whom he had in Egypt were two. Seventy persons of the family of Jacob came into Egypt.\\n28 Now he had sent Judah before him to Goshen, to get word from Joseph; and so they came to the land of Goshen.\\n29 And Joseph got his carriage ready and went to Goshen for the meeting with his father; and when he came before him, he put his arms round his neck, weeping.\\n30 And Israel said to Joseph, Now that I have seen you living again, I am ready for death.\\n31 And Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's people, I will go and give the news to Pharaoh, and say to him, My brothers and my father's people, from the land of Canaan, have come to me;\\n32 And these men are keepers of sheep and owners of cattle, and have with them their flocks and their herds and all they have.\\n33 Now when Pharaoh sends for you and says, What is your business?\\n34 You are to say, Your servants have been keepers of cattle from our early days up to now, like our fathers; in this way you will be able to have the land of Goshen for yourselves; because keepers of sheep are unclean in the eyes of the Egyptians.\\n

       "26    1 And God gave his blessing to Noah and his sons, and said, Be fertile, and have increase, and make the earth full.\\n2 And the fear of you will be strong in every beast of the earth and every bird of the air; everything which goes on the land, and all the fishes of the sea, are given into your hands.\\n3 Every living and moving thing will be food for you; I give them all to you as before I gave you all green things.\\n4 But flesh with the life-blood in it you may not take for food.\\n5 And for your blood, which is your life, will I take payment; from every beast I will take it, and from every man will I take payment for the blood of his brother-man.\\n6 Whoever takes a man's life, by man will his life be taken; because God made man in his image.\\n7 And now, be fertile and have increase; have offspring on the earth and become great in number.\\n8 And God said to Noah and to his sons,\\n9 Truly, I will make my agreement with you and with your seed after you,\\n10 And with every living thing with you, all birds and cattle and every beast of the earth which comes out of the ark with you.\\n11 And I will make my agreement with you; never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters; never again will the waters come over all the earth for its destruction.\\n12 And God said, This is the sign of the agreement which I make between me and you and every living thing with you, for all future generations:\\n13 I will put my bow in the cloud and it will be for a sign of the agreement between me and the earth.\\n14 And whenever I make a cloud come over the earth, the bow will be seen in the cloud,\\n15 And I will keep in mind the agreement between me and you and every living thing; and never again will there be a great flow of waters causing destruction to all flesh.\\n16 And the bow will be in the cloud, and looking on it, I will keep in mind the eternal agreement between God and every living thing on the earth.\\n17 And God said to Noah, This is the sign of the agreement which I have made between me and all flesh on the earth.\\n18 And the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is the father of Canaan.\\n19 These three were the sons of Noah and from them all the earth was peopled.\\n20 In those days Noah became a farmer, and he made a vine-garden.\\n21 And he took of the wine of it and was overcome by drink; and he was uncovered in his tent.\\n22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father unclothed, and gave news of it to his two brothers outside.\\n23 And Shem and Japheth took a robe, and putting it on their backs went in with their faces turned away, and put it over their father so that they might not see him unclothed.\\n24 And, awaking from his wine, Noah saw what his youngest son had done to him, and he said,\\n25 Cursed be Canaan; let him be a servant of servants to his brothers.\\n26 And he said, Praise to the Lord, the God of Shem; let Canaan be his servant.\\n27 May God make Japheth great, and let his living-place be in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be his servant.\\n28 And Noah went on living three hundred and fifty years after the great flow of waters;\\n29 all the years of his life were nine hundred and fifty: and he came to his end.\\n

Now Joseph was very beautiful in form and face.\\n7 And after a time, his master's wife, looking on Joseph with desire, said to him, Be my lover.\\n8 But he would not, and said to her, You see that my

you, because you are his wife; how then may I do this great wrong, sinning against God?\\n10 And day after day she went on requesting Joseph to come to her and be her lover, but he would not give ear

the prison-house.\\n21 But the Lord was with Joseph, and was good to him, and made the keeper of the prison his friend.\\n22 And the keeper of the prison put all the prisoners under Joseph's control,

       "29    1 Now at that time, Judah went away from his brothers and became the friend of a man of Adullam named Hirah.\\n2 And there he saw the daughter of a certain man of Canaan named Shua, and took her as his wife.\\n3 And she gave birth to a son, and he gave him the name Er.\\n4 And again she gave birth to a son, and he gave him the name Onan.\\n5 Then she had another son, to whom she gave the name Shelah; she was at Chezib when the birth took place.\\n6 And Judah took a wife for his first son Er, and her name was Tamar.\\n7 Now Er, Judah's first son, did evil in the eyes of the Lord, so that he put him to death.\\n8 Then Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother's wife and do what it is right for a husband's brother to do; make her your wife and get offspring for your brother.\\n9 But Onan, seeing that the offspring would not be his, went in to his brother's wife, but let his seed go on to the earth, so that he might not get offspring for his brother.\\n10 And what he did was evil in the eyes of the Lord, so that he put him to death, like his brother.\\n11 Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, Go back to your father's house and keep yourself as a widow till my son Shelah becomes a man: for he had in his mind the thought that death might come to him as it had come to his brothers. So Tamar went back to her father's house.\\n12 And after a time, Bath-shua, Judah's wife, came to her end; and after Judah was comforted for her loss, he went to Timnah, where they were cutting the wool of his sheep, and his friend Hirah of Adullam went with him.\\n13 And when Tamar had news that her father-in-law was going up to Timnah to the wool-cutting,\\n14 She took off her widow's clothing, and covering herself with her veil, she took her seat near Enaim on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was now a man, but she had not been made his wife.\\n15 When Judah saw her he took her to be a loose woman of the town, because her face was covered.\\n16 And turning to her by the roadside, he said to her, Let me come in to you; for he had no idea that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What will you give me as my price?\\n17 And he said, I will give you a young goat from the flock. And she said, What will you give me as a sign till you send it?\\n18 And he said, What would you have? And she said, Your ring and its cord and the stick in your hand. So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she became with child by him.\\n19 Then she got up and went away and took off her veil and put on her widow's clothing.\\n20 Then Judah sent his friend Hirah with the young goat, to get back the things which he had given as a sign to the woman: but she was not there.\\n21 And he put questions to the men of the place, saying, Where is the loose woman who was in Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There was no such woman there.\\n22 So he went back to Judah, and said, I have not seen her, and the men of the place say that there is no such woman there.\\n23 And Judah said, Let her keep the things, so that we may not be shamed; I sent the young goat, but you did not see the woman.\\n24 Now about three months after this, word came to Judah that Tamar, his daughter-in-law, had been acting like a loose woman and was with child. And Judah said, Take her out and let her be burned.\\n25 And while she was being taken out, she sent word to her father-in-law, saying, The man whose property these things are, is the father of my child: say then, whose are this ring and this cord and this stick?\\n26 Then Judah said openly that they were his, and said, She is more upright than I am, for I did not give her to Shelah my son. And he had no more connection with her.\\n27 And when the time came for her to give birth, it was clear that there were two children in her body.\\n28 And while she was in the act of giving birth, one of them put out his hand; and the woman who was with her put a red thread round his hand, saying, This one came out first.\\n29 But then he took his hand back again, and his brother came first to birth: and the woman said, What an opening you have made for yourself! So he was named Perez.\\n30 And then his brother came out, with the red thread round his hand, and he was named Zerah.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "1106  1 Let us then, though we still have God's word that we may come into his rest, go in fear that some of you may be unable to do so.\\n2 And, truly, the good news came to us, even as it did to them; but the hearing of the word did them no good, because they were not united in faith with the true hearers.\\n3 For those of us who have belief come into his rest; even as he has said, As I said in my oath when I was angry, They may not come into my rest: though the works were done from the time of the making of the world.\\n4 For in one place he has said of the seventh day, And God had rest from all his works on the seventh day;\\n5 And in the same place he says again, They will not come into my rest.\\n6 So that as it is clear that some have to go in, and that the first hearers of the good news were not able to go in because they went against God's orders,\\n7 After a long time, again naming a certain day, he says in David, Today (as he had said before), Today if you will let his voice come to your ears, be not hard of heart,\\n8 For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have said anything about another day.\\n9 So that there is still a Sabbath-keeping for the people of God.\\n10 For the man who comes into his rest has had rest from his works, as God did from his.\\n11 Because of this, let us have a strong desire to come into that rest, and let no one go after the example of those who went against God's orders.\\n12 For the word of God is living and full of power, and is sharper than any two-edged sword, cutting through and making a division even of the soul and the spirit, the bones and the muscles, and quick to see the thoughts and purposes of the heart.\\n13 And there is nothing made which is not completely clear to him; there is nothing covered, but all things are open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.\\n14 Having then a great high priest, who has made his way through the heavens, even Jesus the Son of God, let us be strong in our faith.\\n15 For we have not a high priest who is not able to be touched by the feelings of our feeble flesh; but we have one who has been tested in all points as we ourselves are tested, but without sin.\\n16 Then let us come near to the seat of grace without fear, so that mercy may be given to us, and we may get grace for our help in time of need.\\n

       "1107  1 For this Melchizedek, the king of Salem, a priest of the Most High God, who gave Abraham his blessing, meeting him when he came back after putting the kings to death,\\n2 And to whom Abraham gave a tenth part of everything which he had, being first named King of righteousness, and then in addition, King of Salem, that is to say, King of peace;\\n3 Being without father or mother, or family, having no birth or end to his life, being made like the Son of God, is a priest for ever.\\n4 Now see how great this man was, to whom our father Abraham gave a tenth part of what he had got in the fight.\\n5 And it is true that by the law, those of the sons of Levi who have the position of priests may take a tenth part of the people's goods; that is to say, they take it from their brothers though these are the sons of Abraham.\\n6 But this man, who was not of their family, took the tenth from Abraham, and gave a blessing to him to whom God had given his undertaking.\\n7 But there is no doubt that the less gets his blessing from the greater.\\n8 Now at the present time, men over whom death has power take the tenth; but then it was taken by one of whom it is witnessed that he is living.\\n9 And we may say that in Abraham, even Levi, who has a right to take the tenth part, gave it;\\n10 Because he was still in his father's body when Melchizedek came to him.\\n11 Now if it was possible for things to be made complete through the priests of the house of Levi (for the law was given to the people in connection with them), what need was there for another priest who was of the order of Melchizedek and not of the order of Aaron?\\n12 Because if the priests are changed, it is necessary to make a change in the law.\\n13 For he of whom these things are said comes of another tribe, of which no man has ever made offerings at the altar.\\n14 Because it is clear that our Lord comes out of Judah, and Moses said nothing about priests from that tribe.\\n15 And this is even more clear if a second priest has come up who is like Melchizedek,\\n16 That is to say, not made by a law based on the flesh, but by the power of a life without end:\\n17 For it has been witnessed of him, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.\\n18 So the law which went before is put on one side, because it was feeble and without profit.\\n19 (Because the law made nothing complete), and in its place there is a better hope, through which we come near to God.\\n20 And as this is not without the taking of an oath\\n21 (For those were made priests without an oath, but this one was made a priest with an oath by him who says of him, The Lord gave his oath, which he will not take back, that you are a priest for ever);\\n22 By so much is it a better agreement which we have through Jesus.\\n23 And it is true that there have been a great number of those priests, because death does not let them go on for ever;\\n24 But this priest, because his life goes on for ever, is unchanging.\\n25 So that he is fully able to be the saviour of all who come to God through him, because he is ever living to make prayer to God for them.\\n26 It was right for us to have such a high priest, one who is holy and without evil, doing no wrong, having no part with sinners, and made higher than the heavens:\\n27 Who has no need to make offerings for sins every day, like those high priests, first for himself, and then for the people; because he did this once and for ever when he made an offering of himself.\\n28 The law makes high priests of men who are feeble; but the word of the oath, which was made after the law, gives that position to a Son, in whom all good is for ever complete.\\n

       "1108  1 For this reason let us go on from the first things about Christ to full growth; not building again that on which it is based, that is, the turning of the heart from dead works, and faith in God,\\n2 The teaching of baptisms, and of the putting on of hands, and of the future life of the dead, and of the judging on the last day.\\n3 Now we will do this, if God lets us.\\n4 As for those who at one time saw the light, tasting the good things from heaven, and having their part in the Holy Spirit,\\n5 With knowledge of the good word of God, and of the powers of the coming time,\\n6 And then let themselves be turned away, it is not possible for their hearts to be made new a second time; because they themselves put the Son of God on the cross again, openly shaming him.\\n7 For a land, drinking in the frequent rain and producing good plants for those for whom it is worked, has a blessing from God:\\n8 But if it sends up thorns and evil plants, it is of no use and is ready to be cursed; its only end is to be burned.\\n9 But, my loved ones, though we say this, we are certain that you have better things in you, things which go with salvation;\\n10 For God is true, and will not put away from him the memory of your work and of your love for his name, in the help which you gave and still give to the saints.\\n11 And it is our desire that you may all keep the same high purpose in certain hope to the end:\\n12 So that you may not be slow in heart, but may take as your example those to whom God has given their heritage, because of their faith and their long waiting.\\n13 For when God made his oath to Abraham, because there was no greater oath, he made it by himself,\\n14 Saying, Be certain that I will give you my blessing, and make your numbers very great.\\n15 And so, when he had been waiting calmly for a long time, God's word to him was put into effect.\\n16 For men at all times make their oaths by what is greater; and any argument is ended by the decision of the oath.\\n17 So that when it was God's desire to make it specially clear to those who by his word were to have the heritage, that his purpose was fixed, he made it more certain with an oath;\\n18 So that we, who have gone in flight from danger to the hope which has been put before us, may have a strong comfort in two unchanging things, in which it is not possible for God to be false;\\n19 And this hope is like a strong band for our souls, fixed and certain, and going in to that which is inside the veil;\\n20 Where Jesus has gone before us, as a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.\\n

       "1109  1 For this reason, as we are circled by so great a cloud of witnesses, putting off every weight, and the sin into which we come so readily, let us keep on running in the way which is marked out for us,\\n2 Having our eyes fixed on Jesus, the guide and end of our faith, who went through the pains of the cross, not caring for the shame, because of the joy which was before him, and who has now taken his place at the right hand of God's seat of power.\\n3 Give thought to him who has undergone so much of the hate of sinners against himself, so that you may not be tired and feeble of purpose.\\n4 Till now you have not given your blood in your fight against sin:\\n5 And you have not kept in mind the word which says to you as to sons, My son, do not make little of the Lord's punishment, and do not give up hope when you are judged by him;\\n6 For the Lord sends punishment on his loved ones; everyone whom he takes as his son has experience of his rod.\\n7 It is for your training that you undergo these things; God is acting to you as a father does to his sons; for what son does not have punishment from his father?\\n8 But if you have not that punishment of which we all have our part, then you are not true sons, but children of shame.\\n9 And again, if the fathers of our flesh gave us punishment and had our respect, how much more will we be under the authority of the Father of spirits, and have life?\\n10 For they truly gave us punishment for a short time, as it seemed good to them; but he does it for our profit, so that we may become holy as he is.\\n11 At the time all punishment seems to be pain and not joy: but after, those who have been trained by it get from it the peace-giving fruit of righteousness.\\n12 For this cause let the hands which are hanging down be lifted up, and let the feeble knees be made strong,\\n13 And make straight roads for your feet, so that the feeble may not be turned out of the way, but may be made strong.\\n14 Let your desire be for peace with all men, and to be made holy, without which no man may see the Lord;\\n15 Looking with care to see that no man among you in his behaviour comes short of the grace of God; for fear that some bitter root may come up to be a trouble to you, and that some of you may be made unclean by it;\\n16 And that there may not be any evil liver, or any man without respect for God, like Esau, who let his birthright go for a plate of food.\\n17 For you have knowledge that even long after, when he was desiring the blessing for his heritage, he was turned away, though he made his request frequently and with weeping; because the past might not be changed.\\n18 You have not come to a mountain which may be touched, and is burning with fire, and to a black cloud, and a dark smoke, and a violent wind,\\n19 And to the sound of a horn, and the voice of words, the hearers of which made request that not a word more might be said to them:\\n20 For the order which said, If the mountain is touched even by a beast, the beast is to be stoned, seemed hard to them;\\n21 And the vision was so overpowering that even Moses said, I am shaking and full of fear.\\n22 But you have come to the mountain of Zion, to the place of the living God, to the Jerusalem which is in heaven, and to an army of angels which may not be numbered,\\n23 To the great meeting and church of the first of those who are named in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of good men made complete,\\n24 And to Jesus by whom the new agreement has been made between God and man, and to the sign of the blood which says better things than Abel's blood.\\n25 See that you give ear to his voice which comes to you. For if those whose ears were shut to the voice which came to them on earth did not go free from punishment, what chance have we of going free if we give no attention to him whose voice comes from heaven?\\n26 Whose voice was the cause of the shaking of the earth; but now he has made an oath, saying, There will be still one more shaking, not only of the earth, but of heaven.\\n27 And the words, Still one more, make it clear that there will be a taking away of those things which are shaking, as of things which are made, so that there may be only those things of which no shaking is possible.\\n28 If then, we have a kingdom which will never be moved, let us have grace, so that we may give God such worship as is pleasing to him with fear and respect:\\n29 For our God is an all-burning fire.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "1111  1 Now of the things we are saying this is the chief point: We have such a high priest, who has taken his place at the right hand of God's high seat of glory in heaven,\\n2 As a servant of the holy things and of the true Tent, which was put up by God, not by man.\\n3 Now every high priest is given authority to take to God the things which are given and to make offerings; so that it is necessary for this man, like them, to have something for an offering.\\n4 If he had been on earth he would not have been a priest at all, because there are other priests who make the offerings ordered by the law;\\n5 Being servants of that which is a copy and an image of the things in heaven, as Moses, when he was about to make the Tent, had special orders from God: for, See, he said, that you make everything like the design which you saw in the mountain.\\n6 But now his position as priest is higher. because through him God has made a better agreement with man, based on the giving of better things.\\n7 For if that first agreement had been as good as possible, there would have been no place for a second.\\n8 For, protesting against them, he says, See, the days are coming when I will make a new agreement with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah;\\n9 Not like the agreement which I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand, to be their guide out of the land of Egypt; for they did not keep the agreement with me, and I gave them up, says the Lord.\\n10 For this is the agreement which I will make with the people of Israel after those days: I will put my laws into their minds, writing them in their hearts: and I will be their God, and they will be my people:\\n11 And there will be no need for every man to be teaching his brother, or his neighbour, saying, This is the knowledge of the Lord: for they will all have knowledge of me, great and small.\\n12 And I will have mercy on their evil-doing, and I will not keep their sins in mind.\\n13 When he says, A new agreement, he has made the first agreement old.

       "1112  1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, and the sign that the things not seen are true.\\n2 For by it our fathers had God's approval.\\n3 By faith it is clear to us that the order of events was fixed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made from things which only seem to be.\\n4 By faith Abel made a better offering to God than Cain, and he had witness through it of his righteousness, God giving his approval of his offering: and his voice still comes to us through it though he is dead.\\n5 By faith Enoch was taken up to heaven so that he did not see death; he was seen no longer, for God took him away: for before he was taken, witness had been given that he was well-pleasing to God:\\n6 And without faith it is not possible to be well-pleasing to him, for it is necessary for anyone who comes to God to have the belief that God is, and that he is a rewarder of all those who make a serious search for him.\\n7 By faith Noah, being moved by the fear of God, made ready an ark for the salvation of his family, because God had given him news of things which were not seen at the time; and through it the world was judged by him, and he got for his heritage the righteousness which is by faith.\\n8 By faith Abraham did as God said when he was ordered to go out into a place which was to be given to him as a heritage, and went out without knowledge of where he was going.\\n9 By faith he was a wanderer in the land of the agreement, as in a strange land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who had a part with him in the same heritage:\\n10 For he was looking for the strong town, whose builder and maker is God.\\n11 And by faith Sarah herself had power to give birth, when she was very old, because she had faith in him who gave his word;\\n12 So that from one man, who was near to death, came children in number as the stars in heaven, or as the sand by the seaside, which may not be numbered.\\n13 All these came to their end in faith, not having had the heritage; but having seen it with delight far away, they gave witness that they were wanderers and not of the earth.\\n14 For those who say such things make it clear that they are searching for a country for themselves.\\n15 And truly if they had kept in mind the country from which they went out, they would have had chances of turning back.\\n16 But now their desire is for a better country, that is to say, for one in heaven; and so it is no shame to God to be named their God; for he has made ready a town for them.\\n17 By faith Abraham made an offering of Isaac, when he was tested: and he with whom the agreement had been made gave up as an offering the only son of his body,\\n18 Of whom it had been said, From Isaac will your seed take their name:\\n19 Judging that God was able to give life even to the dead; and because of this he did get him back as if from death.\\n20 By faith Isaac, blessing Jacob and Esau, gave news of things to come.\\n21 By faith Jacob gave a blessing to the two sons of Joseph, when he was near to death; and gave God worship, supported by his stick.\\n22 By faith Joseph, when his end was near, said that the children of Israel would go out of Egypt; and gave orders about his bones.\\n23 By faith Moses was kept secretly by his father and mother for three months after his birth, because they saw that he was a fair child; and they had no fear of the king's orders.\\n24 By faith Moses, when he became a man, had no desire to be named the son of Pharaoh's daughter;\\n25 Feeling that it was better to undergo pain with the people of God, than for a short time to have a taste of the pleasures of sin;\\n26 Judging a part in the shame of Christ to be better than all the wealth of Egypt; for he was looking forward to his reward.\\n27 By faith he went out of Egypt, not being turned from his purpose by fear of the wrath of the king; for he kept on his way, as seeing him who is unseen.\\n28 By faith he kept the Passover, and put the sign of the blood on the houses, so that the angel of destruction might not put their oldest sons to death.\\n29 By faith they went through the Red Sea as if it had been dry land, though the Egyptians were overcome by the water when they made an attempt to do the same.\\n30 By faith the walls of Jericho came down, after they had been circled for seven days.\\n31 By faith Rahab, the loose woman, was not put to death with those who had gone against God's orders, because she had taken into her house in peace those sent to see the land.\\n32 What more am I to say? For there would not be time to give the stories of Gideon, Barak, Samson, and Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets:\\n33 Who through faith overcame kingdoms, did righteousness, got their reward, kept the mouths of lions shut,\\n34 Put out the power of fire, got safely away from the edge of the sword, were made strong when they had been feeble, became full of power in war, and put to flight the armies of the nations.\\n35 Women had their dead given back to them living; others let themselves be cruelly attacked, having no desire to go free, so that they might have a better life to come;\\n36 And others were tested by being laughed at or by blows, and even with chains and prisons:\\n37 They were stoned, they were cut up with knives, they were tested, they were put to death with the sword, they went about in sheepskins and in goatskins; being poor and in pain and cruelly attacked,\\n38 Wandering in waste places and in mountains and in holes in the rocks; for whom the world was not good enough.\\n39 And not one of these got the good things of the agreement, though they all had a good record through faith,\\n40 Because God had kept some better thing for us, so that it was not possible for them to become complete without us.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1113  1 For the law, being only a poor copy of the future good things, and not the true image of those things, is never able to make the people who come to the altar every year with the same offerings completely clean.\\n2 For if this had been possible, would there not have been an end of those offerings, because the worshippers would have been made completely clean and would have been no longer conscious of sins?\\n3 But year by year there is a memory of sins in those offerings.\\n4 Because it is not possible for the blood of oxen and goats to take away sins.\\n5 So that when he comes into the world, he says, You had no desire for offerings, but you made a body ready for me;\\n6 You had no joy in burned offerings or in offerings for sin.\\n7 Then I said, See, I have come to do your pleasure, O God (as it is said of me in the roll of the book).\\n8 After saying, You had no desire for offerings, for burned offerings or offerings for sin (which are made by the law) and you had no pleasure in them,\\n9 Then he said, See, I have come to do your pleasure. He took away the old order, so that he might put the new order in its place.\\n10 By that pleasure we have been made holy, by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for ever.\\n11 And every priest takes his place at the altar day by day, doing what is necessary, and making again and again the same offerings which are never able to take away sins.\\n12 But when Jesus had made one offering for sins for ever, he took his place at the right hand of God;\\n13 And has been waiting there from that time, till all who are against him are made a foot-rest for his feet.\\n14 Because by one offering he has made complete for ever those who are made holy.\\n15 And the Holy Spirit is a witness for us: for after he had said,\\n16 This is the agreement which I will make with them after those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws in their hearts, writing them in their minds; he said,\\n17 And I will keep no more memory of their sins and of their evil-doings.\\n18 Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no more offering for sin.\\n19 So then, my brothers, being able to go into the holy place without fear, because of the blood of Jesus,\\n20 By the new and living way which he made open for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;\\n21 And having a great priest over the house of God,\\n22 Let us go in with true hearts, in certain faith, having our hearts made free from the sense of sin and our bodies washed with clean water:\\n23 Let us keep the witness of our hope strong and unshaking, for he is true who has given his word:\\n24 And let us be moving one another at all times to love and good works;\\n25 Not giving up our meetings, as is the way of some, but keeping one another strong in faith; and all the more because you see the day coming near.\\n26 For if we do evil on purpose after we have had the knowledge of what is true, there is no more offering for sins,\\n27 But only a great fear of being judged, and of the fire of wrath which will be the destruction of the haters of God.\\n28 A man who has gone against the law of Moses is put to death without pity on the word of two or three witnesses:\\n29 But will not the man by whom the Son of God has been crushed under foot, and the blood of the agreement with which he was washed clean has been taken as an unholy thing, and who has had no respect for the Spirit of grace, be judged bad enough for a very much worse punishment?\\n30 For we have had experience of him who says, Punishment is mine, I will give reward. And again, The Lord will be judge of his people.\\n31 We may well go in fear of falling into the hands of the living God.\\n32 But give thought to the days after you had seen the light, when you went through a great war of troubles;\\n33 In part, in being attacked by angry words and cruel acts, before the eyes of everyone, and in part, in being united with those who were attacked in this way.\\n34 For you had pity on those who were in prison, and had joy in the loss of your property, in the knowledge that you still had a better property and one which you would keep for ever.\\n35 So do not give up your hope which will be greatly rewarded.\\n36 For, having done what was right in God's eyes, you have need of waiting before his word has effect for you.\\n37 In a very little time he who is coming will come; he will not be slow.\\n38 But the upright man will be living by his faith; and if he goes back, my soul will have no pleasure in him.\\n39 But we are not of those who go back to destruction; but of those who have faith even to the salvation of the soul.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "1114  1 Now the first agreement had its rules of worship, and a holy order.\\n2 For the first Tent was made ready, having in it the vessels for the lights and the table and the ordering of the bread; and this is named the holy place.\\n3 And inside the second veil was the place which is named the Holy of holies;\\n4 Having a vessel of gold in it for burning perfumes, and the ark of the agreement, which was covered with gold and which had in it a pot made of gold for the manna, and Aaron's rod which put out buds, and the stones with the writing of the agreement;\\n5 And over it were the winged ones of glory with their wings covering the mercy-seat; about which it is not possible now to say anything in detail.\\n6 Now while these things were in existence, the priests went into the first Tent at all times, for prayer and the making of offerings.\\n7 But only the high priest went into the second, once a year, not without making an offering of blood for himself and for the errors of the people:\\n8 The Holy Spirit witnessing by this that the way into the holy place had not at that time been made open, while the first Tent was still in being;\\n9 And this is an image of the present time; when the offerings which are given are not able to make the heart of the worshipper completely clean,\\n10 Because they are only rules of the flesh, of meats and drinks and washings, which have their place till the time comes when things will be put right.\\n11 But now Christ has come as the high priest of the good things of the future, through this greater and better Tent, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this world,\\n12 And has gone once and for ever into the holy place, having got eternal salvation, not through the blood of goats and young oxen, but through his blood.\\n13 For if the blood of goats and oxen, and the dust from the burning of a young cow, being put on the unclean, make the flesh clean:\\n14 How much more will the blood of Christ, who, being without sin, made an offering of himself to God through the Holy Spirit, make your hearts clean from dead works to be servants of the living God?\\n15 And for this cause it is through him that a new agreement has come into being, so that after the errors under the first agreement had been taken away by his death, the word of God might have effect for those who were marked out for an eternal heritage.\\n16 Because where there is a testament, there has to be the death of the man who made it.\\n17 For a testament has effect after death; for what power has it while the man who made it is living?\\n18 So that even the first agreement was not made without blood.\\n19 For when Moses had given all the rules of the law to the people, he took the blood of goats and young oxen, with water and red wool and hyssop, and put it on the book itself and on all the people,\\n20 Saying, This blood is the sign of the agreement which God has made with you.\\n21 And the blood was put on the Tent and all the holy vessels in the same way.\\n22 And by the law almost all things are made clean with blood, and without blood there is no forgiveness.\\n23 For this cause it was necessary to make the copies of the things in heaven clean with these offerings; but the things themselves are made clean with better offerings than these.\\n24 For Christ did not go into a holy place which had been made by men's hands as the copy of the true one; but he went into heaven itself, and now takes his place before the face of God for us.\\n25 And he did not have to make an offering of himself again and again, as the high priest goes into the holy place every year with blood which is not his;\\n26 For then he would have undergone a number of deaths from the time of the making of the world: but now he has come to us at the end of the old order, to put away sin by the offering of himself.\\n27 And because by God's law death comes to men once, and after that they are judged;\\n28 So Christ, having at his first coming taken on himself the sins of men, will be seen a second time, without sin, by those who are waiting for him, for their salvation.\\n

       "1115  1 What is the cause of wars and fighting among you? is it not in your desires which are at war in your bodies?\\n2 You are burning with desire, and have not your desire, so you put men to death; you are full of envy, and you are not able to get your desire, so you are fighting and making war; you have not your desire, because you do not make request for it.\\n3 You make your request but you do not get it, because your request has been wrongly made, desiring the thing only so that you may make use of it for your pleasure.\\n4 O you who are false to God, do you not see that the friends of this world are not God's friends? Every man desiring to be a friend of this world makes himself a hater of God.\\n5 Or does it seem to you that it is for nothing that the holy Writings say, The spirit which God put into our hearts has a strong desire for us?\\n6 But he gives more grace. So that the Writings say, God is against the men of pride, but he gives grace to those who make themselves low before him.\\n7 For this cause be ruled by God; but make war on the Evil One and he will be put to flight before you.\\n8 Come near to God and he will come near to you. Make your hands clean, you evil-doers; put away deceit from your hearts, you false in mind.\\n9 Be troubled, with sorrow and weeping; let your laughing be turned to sorrow and your joy to grief.\\n10 Make yourselves low in the eyes of the Lord and you will be lifted up by him.\\n11 Do not say evil against one another, my brothers. He who says evil against his brother or makes himself his brother's judge, says evil against the law and is judging the law: and in judging the law you become, not a doer of the law but a judge.\\n12 There is only one judge and law-giver, even he who has the power of salvation and of destruction; but who are you to be your neighbour's judge?\\n13 How foolish it is to say, Today or tomorrow we will go into this town, and be there for a year and do business there and get wealth:\\n14 When you are not certain what will take place tomorrow. What is your life? It is a mist, which is seen for a little time and then is gone.\\n15 But the right thing to say would be, If it is the Lord's pleasure and if we are still living, we will do this and that.\\n16 But now you go on glorying in your pride: and all such glorying is evil.\\n17 The man who has knowledge of how to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.\\n

       "1116  1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, sends words of love to the twelve tribes of the Jews living in all parts of the earth.\\n2 Let it be all joy to you, my brothers, when you undergo tests of every sort;\\n3 Because you have the knowledge that the testing of your faith gives you the power of going on in hope;\\n4 But let this power have its full effect, so that you may be made complete, needing nothing.\\n5 But if any man among you is without wisdom, let him make his request to God, who gives freely to all without an unkind word, and it will be given to him.\\n6 Let him make his request in faith, doubting nothing; for he who has doubt in his heart is like the waves of the sea, which are troubled by the driving of the wind.\\n7 Let it not seem to such a man that he will get anything from the Lord;\\n8 For there is a division in his mind, and he is uncertain in all his ways.\\n9 But let the brother of low position be glad that he is lifted up;\\n10 But the man of wealth, that he is made low; because like the flower of the grass he will come to his end.\\n11 For when the sun comes up with its burning heat, the grass gets dry and the grace of its form is gone with the falling flower; so the man of wealth comes to nothing in his ways.\\n12 There is a blessing on the man who undergoes testing; because, if he has God's approval, he will be given the crown of life, which the Lord has said he will give to those who have love for him.\\n13 Let no man say when he is tested, I am tested by God; for it is not possible for God to be tested by evil, and he himself puts no man to such a test:\\n14 But every man is tested when he is turned out of the right way by the attraction of his desire.\\n15 Then when its time comes, desire gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is of full growth, gives birth to death.\\n16 Do not be turned from the right way, dear brothers.\\n17 Every good and true thing is given to us from heaven, coming from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change or any shade made by turning.\\n18 Of his purpose he gave us being, by his true word, so that we might be, in a sense, the first-fruits of all the things which he had made.\\n19 You have knowledge of this, dear brothers. But let every man be quick in hearing, slow in words, slow to get angry;\\n20 For the righteousness of God does not come about by the wrath of man.\\n21 For this reason, putting away all dirty behaviour and the overweight of evil, take into your souls without pride the word which, being planted there, is able to give you salvation.\\n22 But be doers of the word, and not only hearers of it, blinding yourselves with false ideas.\\n23 Because if any man is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a glass;\\n24 For after looking at himself he goes away, and in a short time he has no memory of what he was like.\\n25 But he who goes on looking into the true law which makes him free, being not a hearer without memory but a doer putting it into effect, this man will have a blessing on his acts.\\n26 If a man seems to have religion and has no control over his tongue but lets himself be tricked by what is false, this man's religion is of no value.\\n27 The religion which is holy and free from evil in the eyes of our God and Father is this: to take care of children who have no fathers and of widows who are in trouble, and to keep oneself untouched by the world.\\n

       "1117  1 Come now, you men of wealth, give yourselves to weeping and crying because of the bitter troubles which are coming to you.\\n2 Your wealth is unclean and insects have made holes in your clothing.\\n3 Your gold and your silver are wasted and their waste will be a witness against you, burning into your flesh. You have put by your store in the last days.\\n4 See, the money which you falsely kept back from the workers cutting the grass in your field, is crying out against you; and the cries of those who took in your grain have come to the ears of the Lord of armies.\\n5 You have been living delicately on earth and have taken your pleasure; you have made your hearts fat for a day of destruction.\\n6 You have given your decision against the upright man and have put him to death. He puts up no fight against you.\\n7 Go on waiting calmly, my brothers, till the coming of the Lord, like the farmer waiting for the good fruit of the earth till the early and late rains have come.\\n8 Be as calm in your waiting; let your hearts be strong: because the coming of the Lord is near.\\n9 Say no hard things against one another, brothers, so that you will not be judged; see, the judge is waiting at the doors.\\n10 Take as an example of pain nobly undergone and of strength in trouble, the prophets who gave to men the words of the Lord.\\n11 We say that those men who have gone through pain are happy: you have the story of Job and the troubles through which he went and have seen that the Lord was full of pity and mercy in the end.\\n12 But most of all, my brothers, do not take oaths, not by the heaven, or by the earth, or by any other thing: but let your Yes be Yes, and your No be No: so that you may not be judged.\\n13 Is anyone among you in trouble? let him say prayers. Is anyone glad? let him make a song of praise.\\n14 Is anyone among you ill? let him send for the rulers of the church; and let them say prayers over him, putting oil on him in the name of the Lord.\\n15 And by the prayer of faith the man who is ill will be made well, and he will be lifted up by the Lord, and for any sin which he has done he will have forgiveness.\\n16 So then, make a statement of your sins to one another, and say prayers for one another so that you may be made well. The prayer of a good man is full of power in its working.\\n17 Elijah was a man of flesh and blood as we are, and he made a strong prayer that there might be no rain; and there was no rain on the earth for three years and six months.\\n18 And he made another prayer, and the heaven sent down rain and the earth gave her fruit.\\n19 My brothers, if one of you has gone out of the way of the true faith and another has made him see his error,\\n20 Be certain that he through whom a sinner has been turned from the error of his way, keeps a soul from death and is the cause of forgiveness for sins without number.\\n

Are not the men of wealth rulers over you? do they not take you by force before their judges?\\n7 Do they not say evil of the holy name which was given to you?\\n8 But if you keep the greatest law of all, as it is given in the holy Writings, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself, you do well:\\n9 But if you take a man's position into account, you do evil, and are judged as evil-doers by the law.\\n10 For anyone who keeps all the law, but makes a slip in one point, is judged to have gone against it all.\\n11 For he who said, Do not be untrue in married life, is the same who said, Put no man to death. Now if you are not untrue in married life, but you put a man to death, the law is broken.\\n12 Let your words and your acts be those of men who are to be judged by the law which makes free.\\n13 For the man who has had no mercy will be judged without mercy, but mercy takes pride in overcoming judging.\\n14 What use is it, my brothers, for a man to say that he has faith, if he does nothing? will such a faith give him salvation?\\n15 If a brother or a sister is without clothing and in need of the day's food,\\n16 And one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warm and full of food; but you do not give them the things of which their bodies have need, what profit is there in this?\\n17 Even so faith without works is dead.\\n18 But a man may say, You have faith and I have works; let me see your faith without your works, and I will make my faith clear to you by my works.\\n19 You have the belief that God is one, and you do well: the evil spirits have the same belief, shaking with fear.\\n20 Do you not see, O foolish man, that faith without works is of no use?\\n21 Was not the righteousness of Abraham our father judged by his works, when he made an offering of Isaac his son on the altar?\\n22 You see that his faith was helping his works and was made complete by them;\\n23 And the holy Writings were put into effect which said, And Abraham had faith in God and it was put to his account as righteousness; and he was named the friend of God.\\n24 You see that a man's righteousness is judged by his works and not by his faith only.\\n25 And in the same way, was not the righteousness of Rahab, the loose woman, judged by her works, when she took into her house those who were sent and let them go out by another way?\\n26 For as the body without the spirit is dead even so faith without works is dead.\\n

       "1119  1 Do not all be teachers, my brothers, because we teachers will be judged more hardly than others.\\n2 For we all go wrong in a number of things. If a man never makes a slip in his talk, then he is a complete man and able to keep all his body in control.\\n3 Now if we put bits of iron into horses' mouths so that they may be guided by us, we have complete control of their bodies.\\n4 And again ships, though they are so great and are moved by violent winds, are turned by a very small guiding-blade, at the impulse of the man who is using it.\\n5 Even so the tongue is a small part of the body, but it takes credit for great things. How much wood may be lighted by a very little fire!\\n6 And the tongue is a fire; it is the power of evil placed in our bodies, making all the body unclean, putting the wheel of life on fire, and getting its fire from hell.\\n7 For every sort of beast and bird and every living thing on earth and in the sea has been controlled by man and is under his authority;\\n8 But the tongue may not be controlled by man; it is an unresting evil, it is full of the poison of death.\\n9 With it we give praise to our Lord and Father; and with it we put a curse on men who are made in God's image.\\n10 Out of the same mouth comes blessing and cursing. My brothers, it is not right for these things to be so.\\n11 Does the fountain send from the same outlet sweet and bitter water?\\n12 Is a fig-tree able to give us olives, my brothers, or do we get figs from a vine, or sweet water from the salt sea?\\n13 Who has wisdom and good sense among you? let him make his works clear by a life of gentle wisdom.\\n14 But if you have bitter envy in your heart and the desire to get the better of others, have no pride in this, talking falsely against what is true.\\n15 This wisdom is not from heaven, but is of the earth and the flesh and the Evil One.\\n16 For where envy is, and the desire to get the better of others, there is no order, but every sort of evil-doing.\\n17 But the wisdom which is from heaven is first holy, then gentle, readily giving way in argument, full of peace and mercy and good works, not doubting, not seeming other than it is.\\n18 And the fruit of righteousness is planted in peace for those who make peace.\\n

       "1120  1 Peter, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, to the saints who are living in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,\\n2 Who, through the purpose of God, have been made holy by the Spirit, disciples of Jesus, made clean by his blood: May you have grace and peace in full measure.\\n3 Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who through his great mercy has given us a new birth and a living hope by the coming again of Jesus Christ from the dead,\\n4 And a heritage fair, holy and for ever new, waiting in heaven for you,\\n5 Who, by the power of God are kept, through faith, for that salvation, which will be seen at the last day.\\n6 You have cause for great joy in this, though it may have been necessary for you to be troubled for a little time, being tested in all sorts of ways,\\n7 So that the true metal of your faith, being of much greater value than gold (which, though it comes to an end, is tested by fire), may come to light in praise and glory and honour, at the revelation of Jesus Christ:\\n8 To whom your love is given, though you have not seen him; and the faith which you have in him, though you do not see him now, gives you joy greater than words and full of glory:\\n9 For so you have the true end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.\\n10 For the prophets who gave the news of the grace which would come to you, made search with all care for knowledge of this salvation;\\n11 Attempting to see what sort of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them was pointing to, when it gave witness to the pains which Christ would undergo and the glories which would come after them.\\n12 And it was made clear to those prophets that they were God's servants not for themselves but for you, to give you word of the things which have now come to your ears from the preachers of the good news through the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven; things which even angels have a desire to see.\\n13 So make your minds ready, and keep on the watch, hoping with all your power for the grace which is to come to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;\\n14 Like children ruled by God, do not go back to the old desires of the time when you were without knowledge:\\n15 But be holy in every detail of your lives, as he, whose servants you are, is holy;\\n16 Because it has been said in the Writings, You are to be holy, for I am holy.\\n17 And if you give the name of Father to him who, judging every man by his acts, has no respect for a man's position, then go in fear while you are on this earth:\\n18 Being conscious that you have been made free from that foolish way of life which was your heritage from your fathers, not through a payment of things like silver or gold which come to destruction,\\n19 But through holy blood, like that of a clean and unmarked lamb, even the blood of Christ:\\n20 Who was marked out by God before the making of the world, but was caused to be seen in these last times for you,\\n21 Who through him have faith in God who took him up again from the dead into glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God.\\n22 And as you have made your souls clean, being ruled by what is true, and loving one another without deceit, see that your love is warm and from the heart:\\n23 Because you have had a new birth, not from the seed of man, but from eternal seed, through the word of a living and unchanging God.\\n24 For it is said, All flesh is like grass, and all its glory like the flower of the grass. The grass becomes dry and the flower dead:\\n25 But the word of the Lord is eternal. And this is the word of the good news which was given to you.\\n

       "1121  1 But there were false prophets among the people, as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly put forward wrong teachings for your destruction, even turning away from the Lord who gave himself for them; whose destruction will come quickly, and they themselves will be the cause of it.\\n2 And a great number will go with them in their evil ways, through whom the true way will have a bad name.\\n3 And in their desire for profit they will come to you with words of deceit, like traders doing business in souls: whose punishment has been ready for a long time and their destruction is watching for them.\\n4 For if God did not have pity for the angels who did evil, but sent them down into hell, to be kept in chains of eternal night till they were judged;\\n5 And did not have mercy on the world which then was, but only kept safe Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when he let loose the waters over the world of the evil-doers;\\n6 And sent destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah, burning them up with fire as an example to those whose way of life might in the future be unpleasing to him;\\n7 And kept safe Lot, the upright man, who was deeply troubled by the unclean life of the evil-doers\\n8 (Because the soul of that upright man living among them was pained from day to day by seeing and hearing their crimes):\\n9 The Lord is able to keep the upright safe in the time of testing, and to keep evil-doers under punishment till the day of judging;\\n10 But specially those who go after the unclean desires of the flesh, and make sport of authority. Ready to take chances, uncontrolled, they have no fear of saying evil of those in high places:\\n11 Though the angels, who are greater in strength and power, do not make use of violent language against them before the Lord.\\n12 But these men, like beasts without reason, whose natural use is to be taken and put to death, crying out against things of which they have no knowledge, will undergo that same destruction which they are designing for others;\\n13 For the evil which overtakes them is the reward of their evil-doing: such men take their pleasure in the delights of the flesh even in the daytime; they are like the marks of a disease, like poisoned wounds among you, feasting together with you in joy;\\n14 Having eyes full of evil desire, never having enough of sin; turning feeble souls out of the true way; they are children of cursing, whose hearts are well used to bitter envy;\\n15 Turning out of the true way, they have gone wandering in error, after the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who was pleased to take payment for wrongdoing;\\n16 But his wrongdoing was pointed out to him: an ass, talking with a man's voice, put a stop to the error of the prophet.\\n17 These are fountains without water, and mists before a driving storm; for whom the eternal night is kept in store.\\n18 For with high-sounding false words, making use of the attraction of unclean desires of the flesh, they get into their power those newly made free from those who are living in error;\\n19 Saying that they will be free, while they themselves are the servants of destruction; because whatever gets the better of a man makes a servant of him.\\n20 For if, after they have got free from the unclean things of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again taken in the net and overcome, their last condition is worse than their first.\\n21 For it would have been better for them to have had no knowledge of the way of righteousness, than to go back again from the holy law which was given to them, after having knowledge of it.\\n22 They are an example of that true saying, The dog has gone back to the food it had put out, and the pig which had been washed to its rolling in the dirty earth.\\n

       "1122  1 My loved ones, this is now my second letter to you, and in this as in the first, I am attempting to keep your true minds awake;\\n2 So that you may keep in mind the words of the holy prophets in the past, and the law of the Lord and Saviour which was given to you by his Apostles.\\n3 Having first of all the knowledge that in the last days there will be men who, ruled by their evil desires, will make sport of holy things,\\n4 Saying, Where is the hope of his coming? From the death of the fathers till now everything has gone on as it was from the making of the world.\\n5 But in taking this view they put out of their minds the memory that in the old days there was a heaven, and an earth lifted out of the water and circled by water, by the word of God;\\n6 And that the world which then was came to an end through the overflowing of the waters.\\n7 But the present heaven and the present earth have been kept for destruction by fire, which is waiting for them on the day of the judging and destruction of evil men.\\n8 But, my loved ones, keep in mind this one thing, that with the Lord one day is the same as a thousand years, and a thousand years are no more than one day.\\n9 The Lord is not slow in keeping his word, as he seems to some, but he is waiting in mercy for you, not desiring the destruction of any, but that all may be turned from their evil ways.\\n10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief; and in that day the heavens will be rolled up with a great noise, and the substance of the earth will be changed by violent heat, and the world and everything in it will be burned up.\\n11 Seeing then that all these things are coming to such an end, what sort of persons is it right for you to be, in all holy behaviour and righteousness,\\n12 Looking for and truly desiring the coming of the day of God, when the heavens will come to an end through fire, and the substance of the earth will be changed by the great heat?\\n13 But having faith in his word, we are looking for a new heaven and a new earth, which will be the resting-place of righteousness.\\n14 For this reason, my loved ones, as you are looking for these things, take great care that when he comes you may be in peace before him, free from sin and every evil thing.\\n15 And be certain that the long waiting of the Lord is for salvation; even as our brother Paul has said in his letters to you, from the wisdom which was given to him;\\n16 And as he said in all his letters, which had to do with these things; in which are some hard sayings, so that, like the rest of the holy Writings, they are twisted by those who are uncertain and without knowledge, to the destruction of their souls.\\n17 For this reason, my loved ones, having knowledge of these things before they take place, take care that you are not turned away by the error of the uncontrolled, so falling from your true faith.\\n18 But be increased in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. May he have glory now and for ever. So be it.\\n

       "1123  1 Simon Peter, a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who with us have a part in the same holy faith in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ:\\n2 May grace and peace ever be increasing in you, in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;\\n3 Because by his power he has given us everything necessary for life and righteousness, through the knowledge of him who has been our guide by his glory and virtue;\\n4 And through this he has given us the hope of great rewards highly to be valued; so that by them we might have our part in God's being, and be made free from the destruction which is in the world through the desires of the flesh.\\n5 So, for this very cause, take every care; joining virtue to faith, and knowledge to virtue,\\n6 And self-control to knowledge, and a quiet mind to self-control, and fear of God to a quiet mind,\\n7 And love of the brothers to fear of God, and to love of the brothers, love itself.\\n8 For if you have these things in good measure, they will make you fertile and full of fruit in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.\\n9 For the man who has not these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having no memory of how he was made clean from his old sins.\\n10 For this reason, my brothers, take all the more care to make your selection and approval certain; for if you do these things you will never have a fall:\\n11 For so the way will be open to you into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\\n12 For this reason I will be ready at all times to keep your memory of these things awake, though you have the knowledge of them now and are well based in your present faith.\\n13 And it seems right to me, as long as I am in this tent of flesh, to keep your minds awake by working on your memory;\\n14 For I am conscious that in a short time I will have to put off this tent of flesh, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.\\n15 And I will take every care so that you may have a clear memory of these things after my death.\\n16 For when we gave you news of the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, our teaching was not based on stories put together by art, but we were eye-witnesses of his glory.\\n17 For God the Father gave him honour and glory, when such a voice came to him out of the great glory, saying, This is my dearly loved Son, with whom I am well pleased.\\n18 And this voice came from heaven even to our ears, when we were with him on the holy mountain.\\n19 And so the words of the prophets are made more certain; and it is well for you to give attention to them as to a light shining in a dark place, till the dawn comes and the morning star is seen in your hearts;\\n20 Being conscious in the first place that no man by himself may give a special sense to the words of the prophets.\\n21 For these words did not ever come through the impulse of men: but the prophets had them from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit.\\n

       "1124  1 I who am myself one of the rulers of the church, and a witness of the death of Christ, having my part in the coming glory, send this serious request to the chief men among you:\\n2 Keep watch over the flock of God which is in your care, using your authority, not as forced to do so, but gladly; and not for unclean profit but with a ready mind;\\n3 Not as lords over God's heritage, but making yourselves examples to the flock.\\n4 And at the coming of the chief Keeper of the sheep, you will be given the eternal crown of glory.\\n5 And in the same way, let the younger men be ruled by the older ones. Let all of you put away pride and make yourselves ready to be servants: for God is a hater of pride, but he gives grace to those who make themselves low.\\n6 For this cause make yourselves low under the strong hand of God, so that when the time comes you may be lifted up;\\n7 Putting all your troubles on him, for he takes care of you.\\n8 Be serious and keep watch; the Evil One, who is against you, goes about like a lion with open mouth in search of food;\\n9 Do not give way to him but be strong in your faith, in the knowledge that your brothers who are in the world undergo the same troubles.\\n10 And after you have undergone pain for a little time, the God of all grace who has given you a part in his eternal glory through Christ Jesus, will himself give you strength and support, and make you complete in every good thing;\\n11 His is the power for ever. So be it.\\n12 I have sent you this short letter by Silvanus, a true brother, in my opinion; comforting you and witnessing that this is the true grace of God; keep to it.\\n13 She who is in Babylon, who has a part with you in the purpose of God, sends you her love; and so does my son Mark.\\n14 Give one another the kiss of love. Peace be to you all in Christ.\\n

       "1125  1 So that as Jesus was put to death in the flesh, do you yourselves be of the same mind; for the death of the flesh puts an end to sin;\\n2 So that you may give the rest of your lives in the flesh, not to the desires of men, but to the purpose of God.\\n3 Because for long enough, in times past, we have been living after the way of the Gentiles, given up to the desires of the flesh, to drinking and feasting and loose behaviour and unclean worship of images;\\n4 And they are wondering that you no longer go with them in this violent wasting of life, and are saying evil things of you:\\n5 But they will have to give an account of themselves to him who is ready to be the judge of the living and the dead.\\n6 For this was the reason why the good news of Jesus was given even to the dead, so that they might be judged as men in the flesh, but might be living before God in the spirit.\\n7 But the end of all things is near: so be serious in your behaviour and keep on the watch with prayer;\\n8 And most of all be warm in your love for one another; because in love there is forgiveness for sins without number:\\n9 Keep open house for all with a glad heart;\\n10 Making distribution among one another of whatever has been given to you, like true servants of the unmeasured grace of God;\\n11 If anyone has anything to say, let it be as the words of God; if anyone has the desire to be the servant of others, let him do it in the strength which is given by God; so that in all things God may have the glory through Jesus Christ, whose are the glory and the power for ever.\\n12 Dear brothers, do not be surprised, as if it was something strange, if your faith is tested as by fire:\\n13 But be glad that you are given a part in the pains of Christ; so that at the revelation of his glory you may have great joy.\\n14 If men say evil things of you because of the name of Christ, happy are you; for the Spirit of glory and of God is resting on you.\\n15 Let no one among you undergo punishment as a taker of life, or as a thief, or as an evil-doer, or as one who is over-interested in other men's business;\\n16 But if he undergoes punishment as a Christian, that is no shame to him; let him give glory to God in this name.\\n17 For the time has come for the judging, starting with the church of God; but if it makes a start with us, what will be the end of those who are not under the rule of God?\\n18 And if it is hard for even the good man to get salvation, what chance has the man without religion or the sinner?\\n19 For this reason let those who by the purpose of God undergo punishment, keep on in well-doing and put their souls into the safe hands of their Maker.\\n

       "1126  1 Wives, be ruled by your husbands; so that even if some of them give no attention to the word, their hearts may be changed by the behaviour of their wives,\\n2 When they see your holy behaviour in the fear of God.\\n3 Do not let your ornaments be those of the body such as dressing of the hair, or putting on of jewels of gold or fair clothing;\\n4 But let them be those of the unseen man of the heart, the ever-shining ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great price in the eyes of God.\\n5 And these were the ornaments of the holy women of the past, whose hope was in God, being ruled by their husbands:\\n6 As Sarah was ruled by Abraham, naming him lord; whose children you are if you do well, and are not put in fear by any danger.\\n7 And you husbands, give thought to your way of life with your wives, giving honour to the woman who is the feebler vessel, but who has an equal part in the heritage of the grace of life; so that you may not be kept from prayer.\\n8 Last of all, see that you are all in agreement; feeling for one another, loving one another like brothers, full of pity, without pride:\\n9 Not giving back evil for evil, or curse for curse, but in place of cursing, blessing; because this is the purpose of God for you that you may have a heritage of blessing.\\n10 For it is said, Let the man who has a love of life, desiring to see good days, keep his tongue from evil and his lips from words of deceit:\\n11 And let him be turned from evil and do good; searching for peace and going after it with all his heart.\\n12 For the eyes of the Lord are on the upright, and his ears are open to their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.\\n13 Who will do you any damage if you keep your minds fixed on what is good?\\n14 But you are happy if you undergo pain because of righteousness; have no part in their fear and do not be troubled;\\n15 But give honour to Christ in your hearts as your Lord; and be ready at any time when you are questioned about the hope which is in you, to give an answer in the fear of the Lord and without pride;\\n16 Being conscious that you have done no wrong; so that those who say evil things about your good way of life as Christians may be put to shame.\\n17 Because if it is God's purpose for you to undergo pain, it is better to do so for well-doing than for evil-doing.\\n18 Because Christ once went through pain for sins, the upright one taking the place of sinners, so that through him we might come back to God; being put to death in the flesh, but given life in the Spirit;\\n19 By whom he went to the spirits in prison, preaching to those\\n20 Who, in the days of Noah, went against God's orders; but God in his mercy kept back the punishment, while Noah got ready the ark, in which a small number, that is to say eight persons, got salvation through water:\\n21 And baptism, of which this is an image, now gives you salvation, not by washing clean the flesh, but by making you free from the sense of sin before God, through the coming again of Jesus Christ from the dead;\\n22 Who has gone into heaven, and is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers having been put under his rule.\\n

       "1127  1 So putting away all wrongdoing, and all tricks and deceits and envies and evil talk,\\n2 Be full of desire for the true milk of the word, as babies at their mothers' breasts, so that you may go on to salvation;\\n3 If you have had a taste of the grace of the Lord:\\n4 To whom you come, as to a living stone, not honoured by men, but of great and special value to God;\\n5 You, as living stones, are being made into a house of the spirit, a holy order of priests, making those offerings of the spirit which are pleasing to God through Jesus Christ.\\n6 Because it is said in the Writings, See, I am placing a keystone in Zion, of great and special value; and the man who has faith in him will not be put to shame.\\n7 And the value is for you who have faith; but it is said for those without faith, The very stone which the builders put on one side, was made the chief stone of the building;\\n8 And, A stone of falling, a rock of trouble; the word is the cause of their fall, because they go against it, and this was the purpose of God.\\n9 But you are a special people, a holy nation, priests and kings, a people given up completely to God, so that you may make clear the virtues of him who took you out of the dark into the light of heaven.\\n10 In the past you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; then there was no mercy for you, but now mercy has been given to you.\\n11 My loved ones, I make this request with all my heart, that, as those for whom this world is a strange country, you will keep yourselves from the desires of the flesh which make war against the soul;\\n12 Being of good behaviour among the Gentiles; so that though they say now that you are evil-doers, they may see your good works and give glory to God when he comes to be their judge.\\n13 Keep all the laws of men because of the Lord; those of the king, who is over all,\\n14 And those of the rulers who are sent by him for the punishment of evil-doers and for the praise of those who do well.\\n15 Because it is God's pleasure that foolish and narrow-minded men may be put to shame by your good behaviour:\\n16 As those who are free, not using your free position as a cover for wrongdoing, but living as the servants of God;\\n17 Have respect for all, loving the brothers, fearing God, honouring the king.\\n18 Servants, take orders from your masters with all respect; not only if they are good and gentle, but even if they are bad-humoured.\\n19 For it is a sign of grace if a man, desiring to do right in the eyes of God, undergoes pain as punishment for something which he has not done.\\n20 What credit is it if, when you have done evil, you take your punishment quietly? but if you are given punishment for doing right, and take it quietly, this is pleasing to God.\\n21 This is God's purpose for you: because Jesus himself underwent punishment for you, giving you an example, so that you might go in his footsteps:\\n22 Who did no evil, and there was no deceit in his mouth:\\n23 To sharp words he gave no sharp answer; when he was undergoing pain, no angry word came from his lips; but he put himself into the hands of the judge of righteousness:\\n24 He took our sins on himself, giving his body to be nailed on the tree, so that we, being dead to sin, might have a new life in righteousness, and by his wounds we have been made well.\\n25 Because, like sheep, you had gone out of the way; but now you have come back to him who keeps watch over your souls.\\n

       "1128  1 I, a ruler in the church, send word to the well loved Gaius, for whom I have true love.\\n2 My loved one, it is my prayer that you may do well in all things, and be healthy in body, even as your soul does well.\\n3 For it gave me great joy when some of the brothers came and gave witness that you had the true faith and were walking in the true way.\\n4 I have no greater joy than to have news that my children are walking in the true way.\\n5 My loved one, you are doing a good work in being kind to those brothers who come from other places;\\n6 Who have given witness to the church of your love for them: and you will do well to send them on their way well cared for, as is right for servants of God:\\n7 For they went out for love of the Name, taking nothing from the Gentiles.\\n8 So it is right for us to take in such men as guests, so that we may take our part in the work of the true faith.\\n9 I sent a letter to the church, but Diotrephes, whose desire is ever to have the first place among them, will not have us there.\\n10 So if I come, I will keep in mind the things he does, talking against us with evil words: and as if this was not enough, he does not take the brothers into his house, and those who are ready to take them in, he keeps from doing so, putting them out of the church if they do.\\n11 My loved one, do not be copying what is evil, but what is good. He who does good is of God: he who does evil has not seen God.\\n12 Demetrius has the approval of all men and of what is true: and we give the same witness, and you are certain that our witness is true.\\n13 I had much to say to you, but it is not my purpose to put it all down with ink and pen:\\n14 But I am hoping to see you in a short time, and to have talk with you face to face. \\n15 May you have peace. Your friends here send you their love. Give my love to our friends by name.\\n

There is a sin whose punishment is death: I do not say that he may make such a request then.\\n17 All evil-doing is sin: but death is not the punishment for every sort of sin.\\n18 We are certain that one who is a child of God will do no sin, but the Son of God keeps him so that he is not touched by the Evil One.\\n19 We are certain that we are of God, but all the world is in the power of the Evil One.\\n20 And we are certain that the Son of God has come, and has given us a clear vision, so that we may see him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.

       "1130  1 My loved ones, do not put your faith in every spirit, but put them to the test, to see if they are from God: because a great number of false prophets have gone out into the world.\\n2 By this you may have knowledge of the Spirit of God: every spirit which says that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God:\\n3 And every spirit which does not say this is not from God: this is the spirit of Antichrist, of which you have had word; and it is in the world even now.\\n4 You are of God, my little children, and you have overcome them because he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.\\n5 They are of the world, so their talk is the world's talk, and the world gives ear to them.\\n6 We are of God: he who has the knowledge of God gives ear to us; he who is not of God does not give ear to us. By this we may see which is the true spirit, and which is the spirit of error.\\n7 My loved ones, let us have love for one another: because love is of God, and everyone who has love is a child of God and has knowledge of God.\\n8 He who has no love has no knowledge of God, because God is love.\\n9 And the love of God was made clear to us when he sent his only Son into the world so that we might have life through him.\\n10 And this is love, not that we had love for God, but that he had love for us, and sent his Son to be an offering for our sins.\\n11 My loved ones, if God had such love for us, it is right for us to have love for one another.\\n12 No man has ever seen God: if we have love for one another, God is in us and his love is made complete in us:\\n13 And his Spirit which he has given us is the witness that we are in him and he is in us.\\n14 And we have seen and give witness that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.\\n15 Everyone who says openly that Jesus is the Son of God, has God in him and is in God.\\n16 And we have seen and had faith in the love which God has for us. God is love, and everyone who has love is in God, and God is in him.\\n17 In this way love is made complete in us, so that we may be without fear on the day of judging, because as he is, so are we in this world.\\n18 There is no fear in love: true love has no room for fear, because where fear is, there is pain; and he who is not free from fear is not complete in love.\\n19 We have the power of loving, because he first had love for us.\\n20 If a man says, I have love for God, and has hate for his brother, his words are false: for how is the man who has no love for his brother whom he has seen, able to have love for God whom he has not seen?\\n21 And this is the word which we have from him, that he who has love for God is to have the same love for his brother.\\n

       "1131  1 That which was from the first, which has come to our ears, and which we have seen with our eyes, looking on it and touching it with our hands, about the Word of life\\n2 (And the life was made clear to us, and we have seen it and are witnessing to it and giving you word of that eternal life which was with the Father and was seen by us);\\n3 We give you word of all we have seen and everything which has come to our ears, so that you may be united with us; and we are united with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ:\\n4 And we are writing these things to you so that our joy may be made complete.\\n5 This is the word which came to us from him and which we give to you, that God is light and in him there is nothing dark.\\n6 If we say we are joined to him, and are walking still in the dark, our words are false and our acts are untrue:\\n7 But if we are walking in the light, as he is in the light, we are all united with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son makes us clean from all sin.\\n8 If we say that we have no sin, we are false to ourselves and there is nothing true in us.\\n9 If we say openly that we have done wrong, he is upright and true to his word, giving us forgiveness of sins and making us clean from all evil.\\n10 If we say that we have no sin, we make him false and his word is not in us.\\n

       "1132  1 See what great love the Father has given us in naming us the children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world does not see who we are, because it did not see who he was.\\n2 My loved ones, now we are children of God, and at present it is not clear what we are to be. We are certain that at his revelation we will be like him; for we will see him as he is.\\n3 And everyone who has this hope in him makes himself holy, even as he is holy.\\n4 Everyone who is a sinner goes against the law, for sin is going against the law.\\n5 And you have knowledge that he came to take away sin: and in him there is no sin.\\n6 Anyone who is in him does no sin; anyone who is a sinner has not seen him and has no knowledge of him.\\n7 My little children, let no man take you out of the true way: he who does righteousness is upright, even as he is upright;\\n8 The sinner is a child of the Evil One; for the Evil One has been a sinner from the first. And the Son of God was seen on earth so that he might put an end to the works of the Evil One.\\n9 Anyone who is a child of God does no sin, because he still has God's seed in him; he is not able to be a sinner, because God is his Father.\\n10 In this way it is clear who are the children of God and who are the children of the Evil One; anyone who does not do righteousness or who has no love for his brother, is not a child of God.\\n11 Because this is the word which was given to you from the first, that we are to have love for one another;\\n12 Not being of the Evil One like Cain, who put his brother to death. And why did he put him to death? Because his works were evil and his brother's works were good.\\n13 Do not be surprised, my brothers, if the world has no love for you.\\n14 We are conscious that we have come out of death into life because of our love for the brothers. He who has no love is still in death.\\n15 Anyone who has hate for his brother is a taker of life, and you may be certain that no taker of life has eternal life in him.\\n16 In this we see what love is, because he gave his life for us; and it is right for us to give our lives for the brothers.\\n17 But if a man has this world's goods, and sees that his brother is in need, and keeps his heart shut against his brother, how is it possible for the love of God to be in him?\\n18 My little children, do not let our love be in word and in tongue, but let it be in act and in good faith.\\n19 In this way we may be certain that we are true, and may give our heart comfort before him,\\n20 When our heart says that we have done wrong; because God is greater than our heart, and has knowledge of all things.\\n21 My loved ones, if our heart does not say that we have done wrong, we have no fear before him;\\n22 And he gives us all our requests, because we keep his laws and do the things which are pleasing in his eyes.\\n23 And this is his law, that we have faith in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love for one another, even as he said to us.\\n24 He who keeps his laws is in God and God is in him. And the Spirit which he gave us is our witness that he is in us.\\n

       "1133  1 My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may be without sin. And if any man is a sinner, we have a friend and helper with the Father, Jesus Christ, the upright one:\\n2 He is the offering for our sins; and not for ours only, but for all the world.\\n3 And by this we may be certain that we have knowledge of him, if we keep his laws.\\n4 The man who says, I have knowledge of him, and does not keep his laws, is false, and there is nothing true in him:\\n5 But in every man who keeps his word, the love of God is made complete. By this we may be certain that we are in him:\\n6 He who says that he is living in him, will do as he did.\\n7 My loved ones, I do not give you a new law, but an old law which you had from the first; this old law is the word which came to your ears.\\n8 Again, I give you a new law, which is true in him and in you; for the night is near its end and the true light is even now shining out.\\n9 He who says that he is in the light, and has hate in his heart for his brother, is still in the dark.\\n10 He who has love for his brother is in the light, and there is no cause of error in him.\\n11 But he who has hate for his brother is in the dark, walking in the dark with no knowledge of where he is going, unable to see because of the dark.\\n12 I am writing to you, my children, because you have forgiveness of sins through his name.\\n13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you have knowledge of him who was from the first. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the Evil One. I have sent a letter to you, children, because you have knowledge of the Father.\\n14 I have sent a letter to you, fathers, because you have knowledge of him who was from the first. I have sent a letter to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God is in you, and because you have overcome the Evil One.\\n15 Have no love for the world or for the things which are in the world. If any man has love for the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\\n16 Because everything in the world, the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father but of the world.\\n17 And the world and its desires is coming to an end: but he who does God's pleasure is living for ever.\\n18 Little children, it is the last hour; and as you were given word that the Antichrist would come, so now a number of Antichrists have come to you; and by this we are certain that it is the last hour.\\n19 They went out from us but they were not of us; if they had been of us they would still be with us: but they went out from us so that it might be made clear that they were not of us.\\n20 And you have the Spirit from the Holy One and you all have knowledge.\\n21 I have not sent you this letter because you have no knowledge of what is true, but because you have knowledge, and because that which is false has nothing in common with that which is true.\\n22 Who is false but he who says that Jesus is not the Christ? He is the Antichrist who has no belief in the Father or the Son.\\n23 He who has no belief in the Son has not the Father: he who makes clear his belief in the Son has the Father.\\n24 But as for you, keep in your hearts the things which were made clear to you from the first. If you keep these things in your hearts you will be kept in the Father and the Son.\\n25 And this is the hope which he gave you, even eternal life.\\n26 I am writing these things to you about those whose purpose is that you may be turned out of the true way.\\n27 As for you, the Spirit which he gave you is still in you, and you have no need of any teacher; but as his Spirit gives you teaching about all things, and is true and not false, so keep your hearts in him, through the teaching which he has given you.\\n28 And now, my children, keep your hearts in him; so that at his revelation, we may have no fear or shame before him at his coming.\\n29 If you have knowledge that he is upright, it is clear to you that everyone who does righteousness is his offspring.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

This is the law which was given to you from the first, so that you might keep it.\\n7 Because a number of false teachers have gone out into the world, who do not give witness that Jesus Christ came in the flesh.

love:\\n11 For he who gives him words of love has a part in his evil works.\\n12 Having much to say to you, it is not my purpose to put it all down with paper and ink: but I am hoping to come to you,

       "1135  1 Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and the brother of James, to those of God's selection who have been made holy by God the Father and are kept safe for Jesus Christ:\\n2 May mercy and peace and love be increased in you.\\n3 My loved ones, while my thoughts were full of a letter which I was going to send you about our common salvation, it was necessary for me to send you one requesting you with all my heart to go on fighting strongly for the faith which has been given to the saints once and for ever.\\n4 For certain men have come among you secretly, marked out before in the holy Writings for this evil fate, men without the fear of God, turning his grace into an unclean thing, and false to our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.\\n5 Now it is my purpose to put you in mind, though you once had knowledge of all these things, of how the Lord, having taken a people safely out of Egypt, later sent destruction on those who had no faith;\\n6 And the angels who did not keep to their kingdom but went out from the place which was theirs, he has put in eternal chains and in dark night till the great day of the judging.\\n7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the towns near them, having like these, given themselves up to unclean desires and gone after strange flesh, have been made an example, undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.\\n8 In the same way these dreamers make the flesh unclean, having no respect for authorities, and say evil of rulers.\\n9 Now when Michael, one of the chief angels, was fighting against the Evil One for the body of Moses, fearing to make use of violent words against him, he only said, May the Lord be your judge.\\n10 But these men say evil about such things as they have no knowledge of; and the things of which they have natural knowledge, like beasts without reason, are the cause of their destruction.\\n11 A curse on them! They have gone in the way of Cain, running uncontrolled into the error of Balaam for reward, and have come to destruction by saying evil against the Lord, like Korah.\\n12 These men are unseen rocks at your love-feasts, when they take part in them with you, keepers of sheep who without fear take the food of the sheep; clouds without water rushing before the wind, wasted trees without fruit, twice dead, pulled up by the roots,\\n13 Violent waves of the sea, streaming with their shame, wandering stars for whom the darkest night is kept in store for ever.\\n14 The prophet Enoch, who was the seventh after Adam, said of these men, The Lord came with tens of thousands of his saints,\\n15 To be the judge of all, and to give a decision against all those whose lives are unpleasing to him, because of the evil acts which they have done, and because of all the hard things which sinners without fear of God have said against him.\\n16 These are the men who make trouble, ever desiring change, going after evil pleasures, using high-sounding words, respecting men's position in the hope of reward.\\n17 But you, my loved ones, keep in memory the words which were said before by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,\\n18 How they said to you, In the last days there will be men who, guided by their evil desires, will make sport of holy things.\\n19 These are the men who make divisions, natural men, not having the Spirit.\\n20 But you, my loved ones, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, and making prayers in the Holy Spirit,\\n21 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for life eternal through the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ.\\n22 And have pity on those who are in doubt;\\n23 And to some give salvation, pulling them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear, hating even the clothing which is made unclean by the flesh.\\n24 Now to him who is able to keep you from falling, and to give you a place in his glory, free from all evil, with great joy,\\n25 To the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, let us give glory and honour and authority and power, before all time and now and for ever. So be it.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
